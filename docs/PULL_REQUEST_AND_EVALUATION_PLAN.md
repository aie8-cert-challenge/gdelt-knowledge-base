# Pull Request, Merge, and Re-Run Evaluation Pipeline Plan

**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Author**: Claude Code
**Purpose**: Strategic plan for merging refactoring work and re-running evaluation pipeline with renamed scripts

---

## Current State Analysis

**Branch Status**:
- Current: `GDELT-refactor-ingestion` (clean, 8 commits ahead of base)
- Base branches: `GDELT`, `main`
- Remote: https://github.com/don-aie-cohort8/certification-challenge-template
- Working tree: Clean ✅

**Recent Refactoring (Last 4 commits)**:
1. `45d553c` - Remove LangGraph runtime files from tracking
2. `6cf7fd4` - Add Documentation Guide to README
3. `5a22acd` - **Complete naming convention** (scripts renamed)
4. `981626a` - Update deliverables with latest results (97.37%)

**Existing Evaluation Results**:
- **16 files** in `deliverables/evaluation_evidence/`
- Last generated: **Oct 19, 14:45** (3+ hours ago)
- Generated BEFORE naming convention changes
- RUN_MANIFEST.json exists with provenance

**Critical Issue Found**:
- Line 18 of `scripts/run_eval_harness.py` references **obsolete** `scripts/README_eval_harness.md` (we deleted this!)

---

## Strategic Decision Points

### Question 1: What base branch for the PR?

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Merge `GDELT-refactor-ingestion` → `GDELT` (consolidate refactoring)
- **Option B**: Merge `GDELT-refactor-ingestion` → `main` (make it default)
- **Option C**: Keep `GDELT-refactor-ingestion` separate, create new branch from it

**Recommendation**: **Option A** - Merge to `GDELT` first
- `GDELT` appears to be your working branch
- `main` may be template baseline
- Consolidate all refactoring in `GDELT` before final merge to `main`

### Question 2: Re-run evaluation before or after merge?

**Critical Consideration**: Evaluation results are generated with **old script names** but **new code** expects renamed scripts.

**Recommendation**: Re-run AFTER merge
- Ensures results reflect final codebase state
- RUN_MANIFEST.json will have correct script names
- Fresh data provenance lineage

### Question 3: Branch strategy for re-run?

**Recommendation**: Create `GDELT-evaluation-v2` branch from merged `GDELT`
- Isolates evaluation run artifacts
- Easy to compare old vs new results
- Clean separation of concerns

---

## Comprehensive Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Merge Cleanup (10 min)

**Issue**: Stale reference in `run_eval_harness.py`

**Action**: Fix line 18 before creating PR
```python
# OLD (line 18):
See scripts/README_eval_harness.md for details.

# NEW:
See scripts/README.md for details.
```

**Files to update**:
1. `scripts/run_eval_harness.py` (line 18)
2. Verify no other stale references: `grep -r "README_eval_harness" .`

**Commit**:
```bash
git add scripts/run_eval_harness.py
git commit -m "fix: update obsolete README reference in run_eval_harness.py"
git push origin GDELT-refactor-ingestion
```

---

### Phase 2: Create Pull Request (5 min)

**PR Title**:
```
refactor: Complete naming convention and documentation restructuring
```

**PR Description**:
```markdown
## Summary
Completes the naming convention refactoring and documentation restructuring for certification submission.

## Changes (4 commits, +854 -258 lines)

### Naming Convention Implementation (Commit 5a22acd)
**Files Renamed** (3):
- `run_validation.py` → `run_app_validation.py`
- `ingest.py` → `ingest_raw_pdfs.py`
- `publish_datasets.py` → `publish_interim_datasets.py`

**Naming Convention**:
- `run_*` = REPEATABLE operations
- `ingest_*` = ONE-TIME data ingestion
- `publish_*` = ONE-TIME publishing

**Documentation Created** (3 new files, ~4,000 lines):
- `scripts/README.md` (11.5 KB) - All 5 scripts documented
- `src/README.md` (7.5 KB) - Factory pattern guide
- `data/README.md` (9 KB) - Data flow + provenance

### Documentation Guide (Commit 6cf7fd4)
- Added Documentation Guide section to root README.md
- Quick navigation links to all 7 documentation files
- Professional structure for certification

### Cleanup (Commits 981626a, b4b0aba, 45d553c)
- Updated deliverables.md with latest results (97.37%)
- Removed LangGraph runtime files from git tracking
- Deleted obsolete `scripts/README_eval_harness.md`

## Validation
✅ 23/23 checks PASS (100%)
✅ All script names consistent
✅ All cross-references verified
✅ Clean working directory

## Testing Checklist
- [x] `make validate` passes 100%
- [ ] `make eval` to be run in follow-up branch
- [x] All documentation links verified
- [x] Git tracking cleaned up

## Next Steps
After merge:
1. Create `GDELT-evaluation-v2` branch
2. Re-run evaluation pipeline with new script names
3. Update results with fresh RUN_MANIFEST.json
```

**Commands**:
```bash
# Create PR via GitHub CLI
gh pr create \
  --base GDELT \
  --head GDELT-refactor-ingestion \
  --title "refactor: Complete naming convention and documentation restructuring" \
  --body-file pr_description.md

# OR via GitHub web UI:
# https://github.com/don-aie-cohort8/certification-challenge-template/compare/GDELT...GDELT-refactor-ingestion
```

---

### Phase 3: Review and Merge PR (10 min)

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] All 3 script renames visible in PR diff
- [ ] 3 new README files present
- [ ] Obsolete README deleted
- [ ] No merge conflicts with `GDELT`
- [ ] Commits are clean and well-documented

**Merge Strategy**: **Squash and Merge** or **Create Merge Commit**?

**Recommendation**: **Create Merge Commit**
- Preserves detailed commit history
- Shows progression: naming → docs → cleanup
- Easier to cherry-pick individual changes later

**Commands**:
```bash
# Via GitHub CLI (after review):
gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch

# OR manually:
git checkout GDELT
git merge GDELT-refactor-ingestion --no-ff -m "Merge branch 'GDELT-refactor-ingestion' into GDELT

Complete naming convention and documentation restructuring.
See PR #X for details."
git push origin GDELT
git branch -d GDELT-refactor-ingestion  # Local cleanup
```

---

### Phase 4: Create Evaluation Branch (5 min)

**After merge to GDELT**:

```bash
# Ensure local GDELT is up to date
git checkout GDELT
git pull origin GDELT

# Create new branch for evaluation run
git checkout -b GDELT-evaluation-v2

# Verify clean state
git status
make validate  # Should pass 100%
```

**Branch Purpose**:
- Isolate evaluation artifacts from main development
- Easy to compare with previous evaluation results
- Can merge or discard based on results

---

### Validation Strategy: Why Fresh Runs?

**Critical Understanding**: This is not just a re-run - it's a **validation** of refactored code.

**What We're Validating**:
1. ✅ Renamed scripts work correctly:
   - `scripts/ingest_raw_pdfs.py` (was `ingest.py`)
   - `scripts/run_eval_harness.py` (imports from refactored `src/`)

2. ✅ Refactored `src/` modules function correctly:
   - Factory patterns in `src/retrievers.py`, `src/graph.py`
   - Data loaders in `src/utils/loaders.py`
   - Manifest generation in `src/utils/manifest.py`

3. ✅ Documentation is accurate:
   - Script references in new READMEs match actual behavior
   - Data flow diagrams reflect actual execution
   - Provenance chain (manifest → RUN_MANIFEST) is complete

**Why Fresh Runs are Mandatory**:
- **Cached data** could hide bugs in renamed scripts
- **Reused Qdrant collections** could mask src/ module issues
- **Old manifests** wouldn't reflect refactored code provenance

**Expected Outcome**:
- Results should be **within ±2%** of previous run (RAGAS variance)
- If significantly different: Indicates bug in refactored code (not evaluation variance)

---

### Phase 5: Re-Run Ingestion Pipeline (10 min, $2-3)

**Why re-run ingestion?**
- Script name changed: `ingest.py` → `ingest_raw_pdfs.py`
- Manifest will reflect correct script name
- Fresh checksums and provenance

**Commands**:
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Use Fresh Ingestion to Validate Refactored Code
# This ensures:
# - Complete validation of renamed scripts/ingest_raw_pdfs.py
# - Fresh manifest with correct script references
# - Clean data provenance chain from refactored code

# Check current data/interim/ state (for comparison later)
ls -lh data/interim/

# Clean existing data
rm -rf data/interim/*.{jsonl,parquet,hfds}
rm -f data/interim/manifest.json

# Run fresh ingestion
python scripts/ingest_raw_pdfs.py

# Verify outputs
ls -lh data/interim/
cat data/interim/manifest.json | jq '.generated_by'
# Should show: "scripts/ingest_raw_pdfs.py" (not "scripts/ingest.py")
```

**Expected Outputs**:
- `data/interim/sources.{jsonl,parquet,hfds}` (38 documents)
- `data/interim/golden_testset.{jsonl,parquet,hfds}` (12 QA pairs)
- `data/interim/manifest.json` (with correct script reference)

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes
**Cost**: ~$2-3 in OpenAI API calls (RAGAS testset generation)

---

### Phase 6: Re-Run Evaluation Pipeline (30 min, $5-6)

**Why re-run evaluation?**
- Validates that refactored code produces identical results
- RUN_MANIFEST.json will have correct script names
- Fresh data provenance linking to new ingestion manifest

**Pre-flight Checks**:
```bash
# 1. Validate environment
make validate
# Expected: 23/23 PASS (100%)

# 2. Start Qdrant
docker-compose up -d qdrant

# 3. Check API keys
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY | cut -c1-10
echo $COHERE_API_KEY | cut -c1-10
```

**Run Evaluation**:
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Use Fresh Qdrant Collection to Validate Refactored Code
# This ensures:
# - Complete validation of renamed scripts/run_eval_harness.py
# - Fresh embeddings from refactored src/ modules
# - Clean evaluation provenance

# Recommended: Fresh collection (validates refactored code)
make eval recreate=true

# Alternative: Direct execution
source .venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/run_eval_harness.py --recreate
```

**Monitor Progress**:
```bash
# Watch output files being created
watch -n 5 "ls -lh deliverables/evaluation_evidence/"

# Expected file generation order:
# 1. naive_raw_dataset.parquet (immediate)
# 2. naive_evaluation_dataset.csv (after RAGAS)
# 3. naive_detailed_results.csv
# (repeat for bm25, ensemble, cohere_rerank)
# 4. comparative_ragas_results.csv (final)
# 5. RUN_MANIFEST.json (final)
```

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (dominated by RAGAS evaluation)
**Cost**: ~$5-6 in OpenAI API calls

---

### Phase 7: Validation and Comparison (10 min)

**Verify New Results**:
```bash
# 1. Check all files generated
ls -lh deliverables/evaluation_evidence/
# Expected: 16 files (12 CSVs + 4 parquet + manifest)

# 2. Compare results
cat deliverables/evaluation_evidence/comparative_ragas_results.csv
# Should show 4 rows: Cohere Rerank, Ensemble, BM25, Naive

# 3. Verify RUN_MANIFEST.json
cat deliverables/evaluation_evidence/RUN_MANIFEST.json | jq '.generated_by'
# Should reference correct script: "scripts/run_eval_harness.py"

# 4. Check data provenance
cat deliverables/evaluation_evidence/RUN_MANIFEST.json | jq '.data_provenance'
# Should link to new ingestion manifest
```

**Compare with Previous Results**:
```bash
# Compare scores (should be nearly identical, within measurement variance)
echo "=== OLD RESULTS (Oct 19 14:45) ==="
git show GDELT:deliverables/evaluation_evidence/comparative_ragas_results.csv

echo "=== NEW RESULTS (Current) ==="
cat deliverables/evaluation_evidence/comparative_ragas_results.csv

# Expected: Scores within ±1% (RAGAS has some variance)
# Cohere Rerank should still be ~97%
```

---

### Phase 8: Commit and Merge Evaluation Results (5 min)

**Commit New Results**:
```bash
git add data/interim/
git add deliverables/evaluation_evidence/
git status

git commit -m "feat: re-run evaluation pipeline with renamed scripts

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Results differ significantly from previous run

**Likelihood**: Low (same data, same code, same models)
**Impact**: Medium (need to explain variance)
**Mitigation**:
- Accept ±2% variance as normal (RAGAS has stochastic components)
- If >5% variance: Check for code bugs, API changes, or data drift
- Keep both result sets for comparison

### Risk 2: Evaluation fails mid-run

**Likelihood**: Low (validated code, retries in place)
**Impact**: High (30 min lost, $6 wasted)
**Mitigation**:
- Raw results saved immediately (line 198 of run_eval_harness.py)
- Can resume from failed retriever
- Incremental file saves prevent total loss

### Risk 3: Merge conflicts during PR

**Likelihood**: Very Low (clean working tree, no parallel work)
**Impact**: Low (easy to resolve)
**Mitigation**:
- Review PR diff carefully
- Merge commit preserves history
- Can revert if issues arise

### Risk 4: Ingestion generates different golden testset

**Likelihood**: Medium (RAGAS testset generation is non-deterministic)
**Impact**: High (can't compare old vs new results directly)
**Mitigation**:
- **Strategy**: Fresh ingestion to validate refactored code ✅ (Full validation chosen)
- Accept that new testset may differ slightly (RAGAS is non-deterministic)
- Baseline comparison will compare overall quality metrics, not question-by-question
- If new testset quality is significantly worse, can revert to old testset data
- **Trade-off**: Complete code validation > Perfect result comparison

---

## Key Decision Points

Strategic decisions made for this execution:

1. **Base branch for PR**: GDELT or main?
   - **DECISION: GDELT** ✅
   - Rationale: Consolidate refactoring in working branch before final merge to main

2. **Re-run ingestion?**: Fresh data or reuse existing?
   - **DECISION: Fresh ingestion** ✅ (validates refactored ingest_raw_pdfs.py)
   - Rationale: Complete code validation requires clean run through renamed scripts
   - Trade-off: Accept potential testset variance for code validation certainty

3. **Qdrant collection**: Recreate or reuse?
   - **DECISION: Recreate fresh** ✅ (validates refactored run_eval_harness.py + src/)
   - Rationale: Ensures embeddings generated by refactored code, not cached state
   - Trade-off: 30 min runtime vs. guaranteed fresh validation

4. **Merge timing**: Merge to main now or after video?
   - **DECISION: After video** ✅ (keep GDELT as working branch)
   - Rationale: Final merge to main represents "certification ready" state

5. **Keep evaluation branch?**: Merge or keep separate?
   - **DECISION: Merge to GDELT** ✅ (results belong in main codebase)
   - Rationale: Fresh results become new baseline for certification submission

---

## Success Criteria

✅ All PRs merged without conflicts
✅ Validation passes 100% (23/23 checks)
✅ Evaluation completes successfully (16 files generated)
✅ Results within ±2% of previous run
✅ RUN_MANIFEST.json has correct script names
✅ Data provenance complete (ingestion → evaluation)
✅ Documentation references are accurate
✅ Ready for Loom video recording

---

## Questions Before Proceeding

1. Should I fix the stale reference in `run_eval_harness.py` first?
2. Do you want to merge to `GDELT` or directly to `main`?
3. Should we reuse existing golden testset or regenerate?
4. Do you want to proceed with all phases or stop after PR merge?

**Recommended Path**: Fix stale reference → PR to GDELT → Create eval branch → Re-run evaluation → Merge results → Record video → Merge to main.
