AI product management asks “**What** should I build, ship, and share, and why?”

</aside>

There are three primary questions **you need to answer** *before you can begin* the certification challenge:

1. What **problem** are you trying to solve?  
*Why is this a problem?*
2. What is your proposed **solution**?  
*Why is this the best solution?*
3. Who is the **audience** that has this problem and would use your solution?  
*Do they nod their head up and down when you talk to them about it?*

Problem, Solution, Audience. 

That’s really all you need.
