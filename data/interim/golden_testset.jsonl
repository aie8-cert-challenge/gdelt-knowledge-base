To gain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve information from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the relevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from the ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that while our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant subgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack consistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology and LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end. 1 Introduction In this work we study several approaches for communicating with a corpus of text via relevant text and knowledge graph (KG) representation and retrieval facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to understand the benefits and drawbacks of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches to corpus management and anlysis when combined with an LLM. Throughout we use as a case study a novel KG derived from the Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT)1 [13] dataset. As a way to enhance LLM outputs, researchers and practitioners have been quick in applying LLMs to query and understand proprietary data through retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) [14]. It has been shown that reasoning over the typical RAG framework, which only takes advantage of the unstructured text articles, fails to capture global information about the provided data [5, 27]. Motivated by this limitation, there has been recent interest in adapting these techniques to the case where our data has a graph structure, so that the LLM can directly ingest important relationships in the knowledge base [5, 7, 15, 31]. More specifically, KGs [8] are graph structures which are richly attributed with typing and semantic information on both nodes and edges. KG techniques provide ways to automatically query and extract information stored in a KG without the user explicitly needing to understand query languages to probe their knowledge base. Typically, these AI-based search algorithms find subgraphs that can be used to answer a user-provided query. The interactions between KGs and LLMs have potential beyond merely question-answering and knowledge extraction (see different research directions outlined by Pan et al. [18]). In particular, reflective of KGs being used to enhance LLM outputs, LLMs can be used to enhance existing KGs or create new ones entirely from scratch. However, exploration of techniques to this end either (1) do not deal with imposing different ontological structures in graph creation or (2) only focus on extracting ontological structures using LLMs 1https://www.gdeltproject.org/ 1"], "reference": "The ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events. This approach allows for retrieving relevant information through direct graph queries and advanced graph retrieval methods. Compared to traditional text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely on unstructured text, the ontology-based KGs provide valuable structured information that enhances question-answering. However, automated extraction of relevant subgraphs from these ontology-based KGs remains challenging. In contrast, LLM-generated KGs capture event summaries but often lack consistency and interpretability. Therefore, the ontology-based framework improves question-answering by offering structured, schema-driven representations of events that complement and potentially overcome limitations of purely text-based RAG methods.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}

It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks.

(integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone. For those needing to access events at 15 minute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries.  SOURCEURL. (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this event in. In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and flow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first report, but is at least in the first few reports.", "<2-hop>\n\nMENTIONS TABLE The Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event table, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the global media system. Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an event which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table. Mentions are recorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a year ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical events being recontextualized into present actions. If a news report mentions multiple events, each mention is recorded separately in this table. For translated documents, all measures below are based on its English translation. Several of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events based on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event. When trying to understand news media spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background knowledge, and complex linguistic structures. Not every event mention will take the form of “American President Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, France.” Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris yesterday for a trade summit. The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on Ukraine.” To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer? Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on Ukraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or perhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy? While additional cues may be available in the surrounding text, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media. Similarly, it would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire world and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor. Even in the case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in Port-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this disambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity. GDELT makes use of an array of natural language processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context. While these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically complex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error. Under GDELT 1.0, the NumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents mentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to six revision passes.

However, with the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together. For example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all appeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in that article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, but there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional roles. GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article. While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new field allows for simple proximity-based contextualization. In the case of the example article above, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to the others. In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other connectivity can be explored. Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity indicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations.  Over 100 New GKG Themes. There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating oil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social issues like marginalization and burning in effigy. The list of recognized infectious diseases, ethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 global humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global currencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking species migration and poaching.  Extensible XML Block. GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for its source material. Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage across the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures. As GDELT encodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and government reports, additional types of information are available to codify. As a first example of this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion words of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and the Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East. Academic literature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the papers cited within that paper. This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation graphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts. Yet, such citation lists are unique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it would be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these kinds of specialized data types. Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called V2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are applicable only to subsets of the collection. Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode highly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. ", "<2-hop>\n\nUnique Record Identifiers. To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier. As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection. The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will make it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. 1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html"], "reference": "The previous GKG system had difficulty associating various data points together, such as linking people, organizations, locations, and their functional roles within the same article.

{"user_input": "How does the GDELT Event Database structure its event records using the expanded dyadic CAMEO format, and in what way does the introduction of unique record identifiers in the GKG align with the practices of the GDELT Event Database to facilitate advanced data referencing and analysis?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their descriptions. GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, capturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2. A wide array of variables break out the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, the Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique array of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both actors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the story of each event “in flight” through the global media system. At present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, however in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 format. The Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note that files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited). With the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at least through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without modification. Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning February 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches back to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. There are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset. The first is the traditional Event table. This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several changes as noted below. In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records all mentions of each event. As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those mentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, including the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus being buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event from that specific news report. The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it possible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases. Those wishing to find the earliest glimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of period “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest events with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the highest Confidence measures. This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each individual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below). It also makes it possible to identify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those with the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific source language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).", "<2-hop>\n\nUnique Record Identifiers. To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier. As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection.

We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references found in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates as possible “anniversary violence” indicators. All day, month, and year dates are now extracted from each document.  Proximity Context. Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the introduction of the new Proximity Context capability. The GKG records an enormously rich array", "<2-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but"], "reference": "The introduction of the Proximity Context capability in GKG Version 2.1 represents the greatest change from version 1.0, enhancing the overall format by providing a richer array of contextual information.

Importantly, Version 2.1 preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format to ensure backwards compatibility, and the system continues to generate daily Version 1.0 files in parallel, allowing users to transition smoothly while benefiting from the new features like Proximity Context.", "synthesizer_name": "multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer"}
{"user_input": "how GCAM with its realtime measurement of 2300 emotions and themes and realtime translation of 65 languages changed the way GKG 2.1 format handle article clustering and inclusion criteria compared to GKG 1.0 and 2.0", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nadds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening entirely new analytic opportunities. Some of the most significant changes:  Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes. The GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment analysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual dimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, French, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Urdu). GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents and reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from LIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”.  Realtime Translation of 65 Languages. GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT Translingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine translation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, representing 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into English for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines. GDELT Translingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the very first glimpses of a world without language barriers. The GKG system now processes every news report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems.  Relevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds. A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now specify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that represents the core focus of the article. GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats. In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use.  Quotes, Names, and Amounts. The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food prices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable item. GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to offer numeric context to global events. In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative. Finally, GDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the evolving language used by political leadership across the world. ", "<2-hop>\n\nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 The GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were released in that format. With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has remained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of significant enhancements to the GKG system. While it was originally intended to release these new features in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these fields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and the need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical representation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to accommodate these goals. Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to the GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification. Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of special subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 compatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be supported for news content. From a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 revolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the GKG stream. Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event stream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG metadata. Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would be grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2. With the introduction of the new GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear that the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, themes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very different GCAM scores. In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture necessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level. Thus, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of extracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the GKG stream. The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering. In addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article to appear in the GKG. Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output. However, many topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy discussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a single location. This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of high relevance to many GDELT user communities. Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in the GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional scores. An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,"], "reference": "The GCAM module, which provides realtime measurement of more than 2,300 emotions and themes across multiple languages, along with realtime translation of 65 languages, significantly impacted the GKG system's handling of articles in the GKG 2.1 format. Unlike the GKG 1.0 format, which clustered articles together based on shared metadata such as locations, themes, people, and organizations, the introduction of GCAM revealed that articles with identical metadata could have very different emotional and thematic scores. Therefore, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents with the same metadata but treats each article as a separate entry to preserve the distinct GCAM emotional assessments. Additionally, the realtime translation capability enabled identification of metadata provenance at the document level, further supporting this change. Moreover, the inclusion criteria for articles in GKG 2.1 were relaxed compared to GKG 1.0 and 2.0; previously, articles needed at least one geocoded geographic location to be included, but with GCAM's emotional scoring, articles without geographic mentions but containing emotional data are now included, broadening the scope of content captured by the GKG system.", "synthesizer_name": "multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer"}
