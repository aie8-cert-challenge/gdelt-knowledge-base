Aksoy, Cliff Joslyn, Benjamin Wilson,\nLee Burke, Tom Grimes\nAbstract\nIn this work we study various Retrieval Augmented Regeneration (RAG) approaches to gain an\nunderstanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in a question-answering analysis. To\ngain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and\nTone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve\ninformation from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art\nlarge language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the\nrelevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework\nfor constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema\nof GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from\nthe ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval\napproaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that\nwhile our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant\nsubgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack\nconsistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology\nand LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end.\n1\nIntroduction\nIn this work we study several approaches for communicating with a corpus of text via relevant text and\nknowledge graph (KG) representation and retrieval facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our\ngoal is to understand the benefits and drawbacks of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches to\ncorpus management and anlysis when combined with an LLM. Throughout we use as a case study a novel\nKG derived from the Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT)1 [13] dataset.\nAs a way to enhance LLM outputs, researchers and practitioners have been quick in applying LLMs to\nquery and understand proprietary data through retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) [14]. It has been\nshown that reasoning over the typical RAG framework, which only takes advantage of the unstructured text\narticles, fails to capture global information about the provided data [5, 27].\nMotivated by this limitation, there has been recent interest in adapting these techniques to the case where\nour data has a graph structure, so that the LLM can directly ingest important relationships in the knowledge\nbase [5, 7, 15, 31]. More specifically, KGs [8] are graph structures which are richly attributed with typing\nand semantic information on both nodes and edges. KG techniques provide ways to automatically query\nand extract information stored in a KG without the user explicitly needing to understand query languages\nto probe their knowledge base. Typically, these AI-based search algorithms find subgraphs that can be used\nto answer a user-provided query.\nThe interactions between KGs and LLMs have potential beyond merely question-answering and knowledge\nextraction (see different research directions outlined by Pan et al. [18]). In particular, reflective of KGs\nbeing used to enhance LLM outputs, LLMs can be used to enhance existing KGs or create new ones entirely\nfrom scratch. However, exploration of techniques to this end either (1) do not deal with imposing different\nontological structures in graph creation or (2) only focus on extracting ontological structures using LLMs\n1https://www.gdeltproject.org/\n1", "metadata": {"producer": "pikepdf 8.15.1", "creator": "arXiv GenPDF (tex2pdf:)", "creationdate": "", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "total_pages": 12, "format": "PDF 1.5", "title": "Talking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs", "author": "Audun Myers; Max Vargas; Sinan G.

{"page_content": "[23, 28].\nThroughout this work we use the GDELT dataset as a case study.\nGDELT is a massive collection of\nnews reports that provide a real-time computational record of global events that is published every 15\nminutes. It aggregates information from various news sources, blogs, and social media platforms to construct\na large collection of data including information on people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions.\nEssentially, GDELT offers a snapshot of the world’s collective events, enabling researchers and analysts to\nexplore complex patterns and relationships within global society. By analyzing this data, it’s possible to\nidentify emerging trends, assess risks, understand public sentiment, and track the evolution of various issues\nover time. The applications of GDELT are diverse and far-reaching. Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT). But in fact GDELT-GKG2 is implemented as multiple\nlinked tables recording information about the relationship between articles and events, and thus effectively\nhas the structure of a relational database. Another important contribution of this paper is to actually realize\nGKG2 properly in the mathematical form of a KG, effectively a graph database, derived from and consistent\nwith its native relational database form. To facilitate this effort, we have identified a lightweight ontology\nfor GDELT in the form of its graph schema, realizing its relational database schema in a KG form.\nUsing the KG that we construct from the GDELT-GKG2 dataset, we provide a case study to explore the\nutility of LLM-based tools to extract information and confirm that the KG can be used for question-answering\nin cases where traditional RAG fails. As part of our analysis, we compare to KGs produced from processing\nvarious news articles with an LLM, prompting it to try and adhere to a reduced version of the same ontology.\nThe current state of neurosymbolic work is noted for the plethora of experimental architectures available.\nWhile details are explicated below in Section 3.2, we preview ours in Figure 1, including the five method-\nological pathways which are quantitatively compared: 1) graph queries on the KG (called the DKG) derived\n“directly” from GKG2; 2) use of G-Retriever2 [7] against the same DKG; 3) RAG against a vector store\nrepresentation of GKG2; 4) G-Retriever against a second KG (called the LKG) derived from using Llamain-\ndex3 [1] against the GDELT source articles; and 5) GraphRAG4 Q&A deployed against a third KG (called\nGRKG) using Microsoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters.\nFigure 1: Pipeline of different experiments ran to analyze the GDELT database using an LLM.\n2https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever\n3https://www.llamaindex.ai/\n4https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/\n2", "metadata": {"producer": "pikepdf 8.15.1", "creator": "arXiv GenPDF (tex2pdf:)", "creationdate": "", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "total_pages": 12, "format": "PDF 1.5", "title": "Talking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs", "author": "Audun Myers; Max Vargas; Sinan G.

{"page_content": "2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3", "metadata": {"producer": "pikepdf 8.15.1", "creator": "arXiv GenPDF (tex2pdf:)", "creationdate": "", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "total_pages": 12, "format": "PDF 1.5", "title": "Talking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs", "author": "Audun Myers; Max Vargas; Sinan G.

{"page_content": "Figure 3: GDELT GKG 2.0 ontology relating articles and events..\nMethods to automatically determine the graphical form of a relational database are widely known [21]. Most\nnaturally, consider a table T with m rows T[j], 1 ≤j ≤m and n columns T.i, 1 ≤i ≤n. Then each of the\nm rows T[j] is represented as a node in one meta-class labeled by the primary keys. This node then has n\noutgoing edges, each connecting to a node in another meta-class representing the field value T[j].i, and labeled\nby the column name. The resulting “star” bipartite graphs are then linked over shared values, including\nacross multiple tables. This method straightforwardly produces a graph schema consistent with a given\nRDB, which may or may not be of sufficient complexity to warrant the lofty description of “ontology”. In\nour case, such a straightforward approach is mostly warranted, although as we will see additional constraints\nin the event table will argue for a somewhat more specific and idosyncratic graph structure.\nAfter understanding the GDELT database schema, we developed a capability to convert (portions of) the\nGDELT database to a KG using an ontology as a graph typing schema, derived from the above relational\nschema. This is shown in Fig. 3, to be interpreted as follows:\n• Nodes in the ontology indicate the types of nodes possible in the KG.\n• Nodes are color-coded to indicate their source relational table.\n• Fields in ⟨angled brackets⟩indicate the field name in the schema.\n4", "metadata": {"producer": "pikepdf 8.15.1", "creator": "arXiv GenPDF (tex2pdf:)", "creationdate": "", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "total_pages": 12, "format": "PDF 1.5", "title": "Talking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs", "author": "Audun Myers; Max Vargas; Sinan G.

{"page_content": "• Solid edges indicate a field in a relational table and are labeled with the type of semantic relation.\n• Dashed and bold edges indicate the structural, one-to-many relations in the relational schema.\nThe naming convention also captures the unique identifier for these csv files, so that ⟨GLOBALEVENTID⟩\nidentifies unique Events, the pair (⟨GLOBALEVENTID⟩, ⟨MentionIdentifier⟩) identifies unique Mentions, as\ndoes ⟨DocumentIdentifier⟩for Articles. We again note that the document and mention identifiers are the\nsame field, but have different field names (e.g., a URL is typically used for the document identifier and the\nsame URL is used for the mention identifier).\n3\nCase Study - Baltimore Bridge Collapse\nHere we will provide an analysis of data collected over a recent and short period of time to do question-\nanswering based analysis. The point of collecting recent data is that the LLMs used have not yet been\ntrained on these events (at the time of this study) and thus the knowledge systems are needed to supply\nthe LLM with relevant information. Specifically, this analysis uses a subset of the GDELT data collected\non March 26th of 2024 from 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM during and after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key\nBridge in Baltimore, Maryland, which occurred at approximately 1:29 AM. This 10 hour window of time\ncaptures the media response to this disaster. We filtered down the collected mentions data to only include\nrows in any of the related data if it included any of the keywords “Baltimore”, “bridge”, “collapse”, or\n“ship”. We then used all GLOBALEVENTIDs and MentionIdentifiers in this reduced mentions file to collect\nthe relevant events and articles. This filtration resulted in using approximately 1.33% of the available data\nwith 371 events, 2047 mentions, and 209 articles.\n3.1\nGDELT Knowledge Graphs\nUsing the GDELT data directly and the scraped text we can construct a total of three KGs:\nDirect KG (DKG): The first KG was simply a direct conversion of the subset of the original GDELT data\ninto an equivalent KG as specified by our ontology in Fig. 3. This KG is shown in Fig. 4a.\nLlamaIndex KG (LKG): The second KG was generated by an LLM deployed against a text corpus con-\nsisting of the source articles collected by scraping URLs of the 209 articles included in our GDELT\nsubset, and enriched with knowledge of the ontology. This KG is shown in Fig. 4b.\nGraphRAG KG (GRKG): The final KG was generated using the same articles as the LKG, using Mi-\ncrosoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters. This KG is shown in\nFig. 4c.\nThe example KG constructed using our ontology (DKG) is shown in a reduced form in Fig. 4a. The nodes\nare color coded based on their source. Note that node and edge labels are not shown in order to facilitate\nclarity. This KG is one component and has 3,469 nodes and 18,052 edges.\nTo construct a KG directly from the corpus of source document text (LKG) shown in Fig. 4b, we used\nMixtral-8x7B [11] as our base model, following the procedure outlined by the LlamaIndex package developers\n[1]. The LLM is prompted to extract triples from the news articles according to a prompt provided in the\nparameter kg triplet prompt. Using the default prompt, the ontology does not get incorporated and the\nresulting KG is a star-shaped graph with a single central node and all other nodes connected to this center,\nthere being no other edges. When we change the prompt to consider the entire ontology, we again get a\nstar-shaped graph. Nontrivial graph structure arose when we prompted the language model with a reduced\nversion of the ontology with adaptation for unstructured text. In particular, our prompt asked for:\n• Vertices of one of the following types: “Event”, “Article”, “Mention”, “Person”, “Quotation”, “Orga-\nnization”, “Location”, and “Other”, with the last type serving as a catch-all.\n5", "metadata": {"producer": "pikepdf 8.15.1", "creator": "arXiv GenPDF (tex2pdf:)", "creationdate": "", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "total_pages": 12, "format": "PDF 1.5", "title": "Talking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs", "author": "Audun Myers; Max Vargas; Sinan G.

This subset of data included\n27 articles with 283 related mentions to 143 events during the Baltimore bridge collapse from midnight to\n10:00 AM EST. The corpus of text was created from web scraping the 27 URLs associated to the articles.\n• Edges of one of the following type: “Related to event where”, “Has quotation”, “Mentions person”,\n“Mentions location”, “Mentions organization”, “Committed action of”, “Has event acted on”, and\n“Affiliated with”, again with the last type serving as a catch-all.\nWhile this reduced description produces a non-trivial knowledge graph, it is worth noting that node and edge\ntypes still struggle to adhere to the prescribed structure, potentially due to the nature of hallucinations. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 4b. This pipeline also struggles with entity and relation resolutions, for example\ncreating separate nodes for ‘Container ship’ and ‘Container ship.’\nThe construction of the GRKG required a language model whose context window exceeded the capabilities\nof Mixtral-8x7B. We decided to use Llama-3.1-8B [22] for this case. It is worth noting that GraphRAG\nindiscriminately generates relations without the prescription of any ontology.\nIt does, however, identify\na specified set of entities with defaults being “organizations”, “persons”, “geo(locations)”, and “events.”\nSimilar to the LlamaIndex pipeline, GraphRAG struggles with entity resolution — an example of which\ncan be seen from the existence of separate nodes for “DALI” and “THE DALI.” It also spawns many small\ncomponents, often being isolated nodes; 435 of 968 total nodes are isolated in this example.\n3.2\nKnowledge Graph Analysis Methodology\nThe three graphs in Fig. 4 show the significant size difference between the DKG, LKG, and GRKG. This is\npotentially due to the summarizing nature of LlamaIndex and GraphRAG to only capture the key edges and\nnodes. Further, we find that the LLM used to create the LKG had considerable trouble with adhering to\nthe prescribed ontology, creating many new edge types outside those originally prescribed. For example, the\nLLM creates a triple (Maersk, Chartered, Container ship) when using LlamaIndex. While factually\ncorrect, the Chartered edge type is not specified in the LLM prompt. Even though the LLM struggles\nto adhere to our proposed structures, many of the edges that are mined from the article text are easily\ninterpretable.\nTo validate the quality of our ontology and to show some of its use cases in an automatic way we provide\na qualitative comparison where we use an LLM for question-answering on the GDELT dataset.

{"page_content": "we have five pipelines on how we implement an LLM for talking to GDELT. These pipelines are shown\nin Fig. 1, where in each case, we use an LLM to produce a final answer from the information obtained\nfrom each retrieval method. We note that this final processing is done with models with 7-8B parameters.\nWith the GraphRAG pipeline we use Llama-3-8B [22] for question answering, and in all other cases we use\nMistral-7B [10] in tandem with the E5-large-v2 [25] embedding model. In order, left to right:\n1. Extract knowledge using direct graph queries to probe the DKG. This method requires an analyst to\nconvert a natural language question into a suitable graph query. Consistent with other techniques, we\nthen use an LLM to interpret and repackage the retrieved information.\n2. Use G-retriever to automatically fetch a subgraph of the GDELT Knowledge Graph from a natural\nlanguage question. This subgraph retrieval algorithm requires vectorizing the nodes and edges of the\nknowledge graph using a language embedding model. Once retrieved, the subgraph is fed into an LLM\nfor interpretation.\n3. Construct a knowledge graph by parsing full-text documents (scraped from GDELT URLs) with an\nLLM and LlamaIndex’s functionality. We then proceed as in (2).\n4. Create a Vector Store using the text Corpus and ask questions in a typical RAG setting. This in-\nvolves using a language embedding model to vectorize text articles (after splitting them into 500-token\nchunks). Given a question, we use the same embedding model to vectorize it and, using the Euclidean\nmetric to identify nearby vectors, extract the most similar text snippets. The original question and its\nassociated context are then fed into an LLM to process an answer.\n5. Build a knowledge graph as in (3), using the GraphRAG ecosystem. We also use the provided question-\nanswering capabilities of the GraphRAG package.\nWe note that it is typically unnecessary to use an LLM in method (1) and the answer can often be inferred\nafter seeing the raw output of the graph query. In this case, the LLM effectively repackages the result of the\ngraph query in an expected way. As such, we view this first method as a ‘ground-truth’ on the constructed\nKG. Tautologically, if the DKG can be used to answer a question, then a suitable graph query is able to\nextract the correct answer. Conversely, if the KG cannot be used to answer a given question, then a suitable\ngraph query can prove that the answer cannot be found in the KG.\nIt is worth noting why we only employ graph queries on the DKG and not those constructed using LlamaIndex\nor GraphRAG. As noted in our empirical observations of the LLM-produced knowledge graphs, these graphs\nhave far less structure than GDELT itself. This lack of defined structure makes it difficult to form useful\nand interesting graph queries.\n3.3\nResults\nTable 1 shows a sample of questions that were passed through each of the five pipelines from Fig. 1. Exact\nqueries to the GDELT knowledge graph were generated by searching for keywords in the edge triples com-\nprising the knowledge graph. Specifically, we searched for keywords in these triples by converting each triple\nto a sentence (stored as a string) and searching therein. We then used the edge induced subgraph from the\nedge sentences where keywords were found. The following keywords were used for each question:\n• What is the name of the Bridge that collapsed and what river was it on?: Bridge, Collapse, River\n• What is the name of the ship that collided with the baltimore bridge?: Ship, Collide, Baltimore, Bridge\n• How many articles did CNN published about the baltimore bridge collapse?: CNN, Baltimore, Bridge,\nCollapse\n• On what date did the Baltimore Bridge collapse?: Date, Baltimore, Bridge, Collapse\n• Who is Brandon Scott?: Brandon Scott\n• Who is Niki Fennoy?: Niki Fennoy\n• What are the top themes present in the data?: Has Theme\n7", "metadata": {"producer": "pikepdf 8.15.1", "creator": "arXiv GenPDF (tex2pdf:)", "creationdate": "", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "total_pages": 12, "format": "PDF 1.5", "title": "Talking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs", "author": "Audun Myers; Max Vargas; Sinan G.

With direct graph queries, we can answer high-level and other types of questions\nthat need us to aggregate information across the dataset. For example, we can easily extract information\nabout recurrent themes or about a particular news source. While GraphRAG also provides functionality\nto answer high-level questions, we found that its performance lacked in this respect. It performed well on\nfine-grained questions. A vector store performed similarly well on these fine-grained questions that can be\nanswered by a small number of excerpts from the source articles. Notably, the second column suggests that\nthe automated search functionalities provided in G-retriever are often unable to retrieve a subgraph that can\nbe used to provide an accurate answer. The problem gets worse when we use the KG created by LlamaIndex\nas our knowledge base, which is unable to suitably answer any question that we posed. These issues may\npartially be due to the out-of-box application of the G-retriever system and careful fine-tuning may improve\nperformance. Regardless, we see the retained value in directly probing our data with hand-crafted queries\nand infer that further developments are needed for these automated information extraction systems to match\nthe baseline performance on questions that require reasoning across the entire corpus.\nBy combining the results of the direct graph queries on the DKG with those of GraphRAG and standard\nRAG, we can provide suitable answers to the all of the presented questions. On one hand, we see that\nthe DKG can provide better responses to high-level or aggregate questions about our data.

We found that while the large KG produced by the GDELT-GKG2 database has rich\ninformation for question-answering, the ad hoc techniques for graph exploration deem further investigation\nfor reliable use. That said, the information stored in the KG produced here is not without flaws, and we\nexpect the example studied here to be useful for the broader synergy between KGs and LLMs as addressed\nby others [18]. While the KGs produced using LlamaIndex captured a summary of the events surrounding\nthe Baltimore bridge collapse, the quality of the resulting structure was not suitable for question-answering.\nThose techniques incorporated into the GraphRAG package did considerably better, but there is room for\nimprovement for answering global questions, resolving duplicate entities, and incorporating ontologically-\nguided relation extraction. We believe the incorporation of the ontology into the relation extraction will\nhave the benefit of allowing tools such as GraphRAG to better answer quantitative questions that only the\nontology based KG pipeline (DKG) was able to answer (e.g., the number of articles published on a topic).\nLarge language models continue to be adapted to solve problems across domains, and the case study on the\nKG built here presents much opportunity for future development.

Higher cosine similarity indicates a greater\nsemantic similarity between the predicted and actual answers.\nraw documents or a curated KG should not be of ‘Either/Or’, but rather integration between these two\nmodalities. Our findings demonstrate the significant value of combining the strengths of both approaches.\nWe believe that by combining news articles in the form of a vector store with the rich ontological structure of\nthe GDELT knowledge graph through an LLM interface, the resulting information extraction system would\nallow for better knowledge retrieval than either component alone. Specifically, the direct knowledge graph\n(DKG) excels at answering high-level or aggregate questions, providing a strong foundation of structured\nknowledge. While the vector store is well-suited for identifying local information within the documents that\nmight be missing or less readily accessible in the DKG, GraphRAG has shown effectiveness on both local and\nglobal information. Therefore, we hypothesize that the optimal approach is the integrated system, leveraging\nthe DKG for broad context and the vector store and GraphRAG for detailed, document-specific insights,\nand for enhanced global information retrieval. Further work must be done to determine the extent to which\nthe textual article data can be used to refine the KG produced here; some of our examples showed that\ninformation stored in the DKG does not truthfully reflect the information in the articles. Conversely, we\nmust determine how the constructed KG can be used to better search the associated vector store. Some of\nthese research directions include the following:\n• Use LLMs to add new information to an existing KG by creating new entities or edge relations. Based\noff our observations with LlamaIndex and GraphRAG, we need careful monitoring to ensure that the\nLLM formats its responses to properly adhere to the ontological structures and other existing structures\nin the KG. To this end, it can be beneficial to adapt the triples in the DKG produced here to fine-tune\nthe language model or guide its output with in-context learning.\n• By introducing RAG capabilities, we can fact check the KG against the raw textual information. For\nexample, we found that Niki Fennoy was only mentioned in 3 articles but misattributed to 11 others.\nThe use of LLMs give a potential avenue to fact-check existing relations.\n5\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is under information release number PNNL-SA-209193.\n10", "metadata": {"producer": "pikepdf 8.15.1", "creator": "arXiv GenPDF (tex2pdf:)", "creationdate": "", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/2503.07584v3.pdf", "total_pages": 12, "format": "PDF 1.5", "title": "Talking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs", "author": "Audun Myers; Max Vargas; Sinan G.

{"page_content": "THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-03-01T13:37:31-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "format": "PDF 1.6", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2025-02-01T02:11:47-08:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20250201021147-08'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150301133731-05'00'", "page": 0}}
{"page_content": "adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-03-01T13:37:31-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "format": "PDF 1.6", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2025-02-01T02:11:47-08:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20250201021147-08'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150301133731-05'00'", "page": 1}}
{"page_content": "of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-03-01T13:37:31-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "format": "PDF 1.6", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2025-02-01T02:11:47-08:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20250201021147-08'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150301133731-05'00'", "page": 2}}
{"page_content": " \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-03-01T13:37:31-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "format": "PDF 1.6", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2025-02-01T02:11:47-08:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20250201021147-08'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150301133731-05'00'", "page": 3}}
{"page_content": "or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-03-01T13:37:31-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "format": "PDF 1.6", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2025-02-01T02:11:47-08:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20250201021147-08'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150301133731-05'00'", "page": 4}}

In essence, it specifies how to interpret the DocumentIdentifier to locate the \nactual document.  At present, it can hold one of the following values: \no 1 = WEB (The document originates from the open web and the DocumentIdentifier is a \nfully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web). \no 2 = CITATIONONLY (The document originates from a broadcast, print, or other offline \nsource in which only a textual citation is available for the document.  In this case the \nDocumentIdentifier contains the textual citation for the document). \no 3 = CORE (The document originates from the CORE archive and the DocumentIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the CORE \nwebsite). \no 4 = DTIC (The document originates from the DTIC archive and the DocumentIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the DTIC website). \no 5 = JSTOR (The document originates from the JSTOR archive and the DocumentIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through your JSTOR \nsubscription if your institution subscribes to it). \no 6 = NONTEXTUALSOURCE (The document originates from a textual proxy (such as closed \ncaptioning) of a non-textual information source (such as a video) available via a URL and \nthe DocumentIdentifier provides the URL of the non-textual original source.  At present, \nthis Collection Identifier is used for processing of the closed captioning streams of the \nInternet Archive Television News Archive in which each broadcast is available via a URL, \nbut the URL offers access only to the video of the broadcast and does not provide any \naccess to the textual closed captioning used to generate the metadata.

NOTE: some \nlocations have multiple accepted formal or informal names and this field is collapsed on name, \nrather than feature (since in some applications the understanding of a geographic feature differs \nbased on which name was used to reference it).  In cases where it is necessary to collapse by \nfeature, the Geo_FeatureID column should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column.  This \nis because the Geo_Fullname column captures the name of the location as expressed in the text \nand thus reflects differences in transliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for \nthe same location.  For example, Mecca is often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly \nspelled Jiddah or Jaddah.  The Geo_Fullname column will reflect each of these different \nspellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the same unique GNS or GNIS \nfeature identification number.  For more information on the GNS and GNIS identifiers, see \nLeetaru (2012). 3  This field is identical in format and population as the corresponding field in the \nGKG 1.0  format.

This can be used to filter counts by geographic specificity, for example, \nextracting only those counts with a landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping.  \nNote that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), 2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still \nprovide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the centroid of that country or state, but \nthe FeatureID field below will contain its textual country or ADM1 code instead of a \nnumeric featureid. \no Location FullName.  (text) This is the full human-readable name of the matched \nlocation.  In the case of a country it is simply the country name.  For US and World states \nit is in the format of “State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the \nformat of “City/Landmark, State, Country”.  This can be used to label locations when \nplacing counts on a map.

(semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This \ncontains a list of all person names referenced in the document, along with the character offsets \nof approximately where in the document they were found.  Each person reference is separated \nby a semicolon, and within each reference, the person name is specified first, followed by a \ncomma, and then the approximate character offset of the reference of that person in the \ndocument, allowing it to be associated with other entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that \nappear in closest proximity to it.  If a person is mentioned multiple times in a document, each \nmention will appear separately in this field. \n \nV1ORGANIZATIONS.  (semicolon-delimited)  This is the list of all company and organization \nnames found in the text, extracted through the Leetaru (2012) algorithm. 7  This is a \ncombination of corporations, IGOs, NGOs, and any other local organizations such as a local fair \n                                                          \n4 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n5 http://blog.gdeltproject.org/global-second-order-administrative-divisions-now-available-from-gaul/ \n6 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n7 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-03-01T13:37:31-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "format": "PDF 1.6", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2025-02-01T02:11:47-08:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20250201021147-08'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150301133731-05'00'", "page": 8}}
{"page_content": "or council.  This engine is highly adaptive and is currently tuned to err on the side of inclusion \nwhen it is less confident about a match to ensure maximal recall of smaller organizations around \nthe world that are of especial interest to many users of the GKG.  Conversely, certain smaller \ncompanies with names and contexts that do not provide a sufficient recognition latch may be \nmissed or occasionally misclassified as a person name depending on context.  It is highly \nrecommended that users of the Persons and Organizations fields histogram the results and \ndiscard names appearing just once or twice to eliminate most of these false positive matches.  \nThis field is identical in format and population as the corresponding field in the GKG 1.0  format. \n \nV2ENHANCEDORGANIZATIONS.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  \nThis contains a list of all organizations/companies referenced in the document, along with the \ncharacter offsets of approximately where in the document they were found.  Each organization \nreference is separated by a semicolon, and within each reference, the name of the organization \nis specified first, followed by a comma, and then the approximate character offset of the \nreference of that organization in the document, allowing it to be associated with other entries \nfrom other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appear in closest proximity to it.  If an organization is \nmentioned multiple times in a document, each mention will appear separately in this field. \n \nV1.5TONE.  (comma-delimited floating point numbers)  This field contains a comma-delimited \nlist of six core emotional dimensions, described in more detail below.  Each is recorded as a \nsingle precision floating point number.  This field is nearly identical in format and population as \nthe corresponding field in the GKG 1.0  format with the sole exception of adding the single new \nWordCount variable at the end. \no Tone.  (floating point number)  This is the average “tone” of the document as a whole.  \nThe score ranges from -100 (extremely negative) to +100 (extremely positive).  Common \nvalues range between -10 and +10, with 0 indicating neutral.  This is calculated as \nPositive Score minus Negative Score.  Note that both Positive Score and Negative Score \nare available separately below as well.  A document with a Tone score close to zero may \neither have low emotional response or may have a Positive Score and Negative Score \nthat are roughly equivalent to each other, such that they nullify each other.  These \nsituations can be detected either through looking directly at the Positive Score and \nNegative Score variables or through the Polarity variable. \no Positive Score.  (floating point number)  This is the percentage of all words in the article \nthat were found to have a positive emotional connotation.  Ranges from 0 to +100. \no Negative Score.  (floating point number)  This is the percentage of all words in the \narticle that were found to have a positive emotional connotation.  Ranges from 0 to \n+100. \no Polarity.  (floating point number)  This is the percentage of words that had matches in \nthe tonal dictionary as an indicator of how emotionally polarized or charged the text is.  \nIf Polarity is high, but Tone is neutral, this suggests the text was highly emotionally \ncharged, but had roughly equivalent numbers of positively and negatively charged \nemotional words. \no Activity Reference Density.  (floating point number)  This is the percentage of words \nthat were active words offering a very basic proxy of the overall “activeness” of the text \ncompared with a clinically descriptive text. \no Self/Group Reference Density.  (floating point number)  This is the percentage of all \nwords in the article that are pronouns, capturing a combination of self-references and \ngroup-based discourse.  News media material tends to have very low densities of such \nlanguage, but this can be used to distinguish certain classes of news media and certain \ncontexts.", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-03-01T13:37:31-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "format": "PDF 1.6", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2025-02-01T02:11:47-08:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20250201021147-08'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150301133731-05'00'", "page": 9}}
{"page_content": "o Word Count.  (integer)  This is the total number of words in the document.  This field \nwas added in version 1.5 of the format. \n \nV2.1ENHANCEDDATES.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This \ncontains a list of all date references in the document, along with the character offsets of \napproximately where in the document they were found.  If a date was mentioned multiple times \nin a document, it will appear multiple times in this field, once for each mention.  Each date \nreference is separated by a semicolon, while the fields within a date are separated by commas.  \nNOTE: this field is identical to GKG 2.0 with the sole exception of the addition of one additional \nDate Resolution type (4 = dates that include a month and day, but not a year). \no Date Resolution.  This indicates whether the date was a month-day date that did not \nspecify a year (4), a fully-resolved day-level date that included the year (3), a month-\nlevel date that included the year but not a day (2), or a year-level (1) date that did not \ninclude month or day-level information. \no Month.  This is the month of the date represented as 1-12.  For year dates this field will \ncontain a 0. \no Day. This is the day of the date represented as 1-31.  For month and year dates this field \nwill contain a 0.  \no Year.  This is the year of the date.  For Resolution=4 dates that include a month and day, \nbut not a year, this field will contain a 0. \no Offset.  This is the character offset of the date within the document, indicating \napproximately where it was found in the body.  This can be used to associate the date \nwith the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest proximity to \nit. \n \nV2GCAM.  (comma-delimited blocks, with colon-delimited key/value pairs)  The Global Content \nAnalysis Measures (GCAM) system runs an array of content analysis systems over each \ndocument and compiles their results into this field.  New content analysis systems will be \nconstantly added to the GCAM pipeline over time, meaning the set of available fields will \nconstantly grow over time.  Given that the GCAM system is debuting with over 2,300 dimensions \nand will likely grow to include several thousand more dimensions within the coming months, it \ndiffers in its approach to encoding matches from the GKG’s native thematic coding system.  \nInstead of displaying the full English name of a content analysis dictionary or dimension, it \nassigns each dictionary a unique numeric identifier (DictionaryID) and each dimension within \nthat dictionary is assigned a unique identifier from 1 to the number of dimensions in the \ndictionary (DimensionID).  Each dimension of each dictionary is assessed on a document and \nONLY those dimensions that had one or more matches onto the document are reported.  If a \ndimension did not register any matches on a document, it is not reported in order to save space.  \nThus, the absence of a dimension in this field can be interpreted as a score of 0.  Each \ndimension’s score is written to the V2GCAM field separated by a comma.  For each dimension, a \nnumeric “key” identifies it of the form “DictionaryID.DimensionID”, followed by a colon, \nfollowed by its score.  Most dictionaries are count-based, meaning they report how many words \nin the document were found in that dictionary.  Thus, a score of 18 would mean that 18 words \nfrom the document were found in that dictionary.  Count-based dimensions have a key that \nbegins with “c”.  Some dictionaries, such as SentiWordNet and SentiWords actually assign each \nword a numeric score and the output of the tool is the average of those scores for that \ndocument.  For those dictionaries, an entry will report the number of words in the document \nthat matched into that dictionary, and a separate entry, beginning with a “v” instead of a “c” will \nreport its floating-point average value.  The very first entry in the field has the special reserved \nkey of “wc” and reports the total number of words in the document – this can be used to divide", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-03-01T13:37:31-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "format": "PDF 1.6", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2025-02-01T02:11:47-08:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20250201021147-08'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150301133731-05'00'", "page": 10}}
{"page_content": "the score of any word-count field to convert to a percentage density score.  As an example, \nassume a document with 125 words.  The General Inquirer dictionary has been assigned the \nDictionaryID of 2 and its “Bodypt” dimension has a DimensionID of 21.  SentiWordNet has a \nDictionaryID of 10 and its “Positive” dimension has a DimensionID of 1.  Thus, the V2GCAM field \nfor a document might look like “wc:125,c2.21:4,c10.1:40,v10.1:3.21111111” indicating that the \ndocument had 125 words, that 4 of those words were found the General Inquirer “Bodypt” \nlexicon, that 40 of those words were found in the SentiWordNet lexicon, and that the average \nnumeric score of all of the words found in the SentiWordNet lexicon was 3.21111111.  For a \ncomplete list of the available dimensions, along with their assigned DictionaryID and \nDimensionID codes, their assigned key, and their human name and full citation to cite that \ndimension, please see the GCAM Master Codebook. 8  NOTE: the scores for all dimensions, both \nEnglish and non-English dimensions, will be listed together in this field – please see the \ncodebooks to determine the source language of a specific dimension.  NOTE: if non-English \ndictionaries are available for a given language and generated at least one match for that \ndocument, an additional “nwc” entry will be added which reflects the word count in the native \nlanguage, since languages may have differing word counts in their native and translated forms.  \nThis count will be absent if no native dictionaries yielded a match for the document. \n \nV2.1SHARINGIMAGE.  (textual URL)  Many news websites specify a so-called “sharing image” for \neach article in which the news outlet manually specifies a particular image to be displayed when \nthat article is shared via social media or other formats.  Not all news outlets specify a sharing \nimage and some sites simply use their logo, but for those that do use this field, it represents the \noutlet’s selection of the single image that best captures the overall focus and contents of the \nstory.  GDELT currently recognizes a variety of formats for specifying this image, including Open \nGraph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats, among others.  \n \nV2.1RELATEDIMAGES.  (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News articles frequently include \nphotographs, figures, and other imagery to illustrate the story, ranging from a single illustrative \nphotograph at top, to lengthy photo essays interspersed through the entirety of an article.  Such \nimagery lends a rich visual tapestry to a news report, helping to clarify, for example, whether an \narticle about a “protest blocking a highway” involves hundreds of activists along its length, or \njust a handful of people in one location, or whether a gas explosion leveled a building or merely \nshattered its windows.  GDELT uses a suite of highly sophisticated algorithms to actually “read” \nthrough each article in the way a human would, evaluating each image on to determine its \nrelevance, based on positioning, captioning, referencing, and context, and compiles a list of the \nURLs of the images it deems to be most relevant to the article.  Thus, unrelated inset boxes, \nadvertisements, and other imagery are ignored and this field contains only a list of images most \nillustrative of the core of the story.  This feature is in alpha release and involves a number of \nhighly complex algorithms working together in concert and thus may make mistakes.  We will be \nimproving this algorithm over time and would appreciate any feedback you may have on the \nkinds of images it incorrectly includes and those that it misses. \n \nV2.1SOCIALIMAGEEMBEDS.  (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News websites are increasingly \nembedding image-based social media posts inline in their articles to illustrate them with \nrealtime reaction or citizen reporting from the ground.  GDELT currently recognizes embedded \nimage-based Twitter and Instagram posts and records their URLs in this field.  Only those posts \ncontaining imagery are included in this field.  This acts as a form of social media “curation” in \nwhich news outlets are wading through the deluge of social media reaction or reporting about a \nspecific situation and hand-selecting key image posts deemed of greatest relevance, \n                                                          \n8 http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GCAM-MASTERCODEBOOK.xlsx", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-03-01T13:37:31-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "format": "PDF 1.6", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2025-02-01T02:11:47-08:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20250201021147-08'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150301133731-05'00'", "page": 11}}

Only image-based embedded posts are \nincluded in this field – videos are identified in the following field. \n \nV2.1SOCIALVIDEOEMBEDS.    (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News websites are increasingly \nembedding videos inline in their articles to illustrate them with realtime reaction or citizen \nreporting from the ground.  Some news outlets that also have television properties may cross-\nlink their television reporting into their web-based presentation.  GDELT currently recognizes \nYouTube, DailyMotion, Vimeo, and Vine videos embedded in articles and records their URLs in \nthis field.  Similarly to the field above, this allows for a form of social media “curation” of the \nvideos deemed by the mainstream media to be of greatest relevance, significance, credibly, \nand/or interest to their audiences.   \n \nV2.1QUOTATIONS.  (pound-delimited (“#”) blocks, with pipe-delimited (“|”) fields).  News \ncoverage frequently features excerpted statements from participants in an event and/or those \naffected by it and these quotations can offer critical insights into differing perspectives and \nemotions surrounding that event.  GDELT identifies and extracts all quoted statements from \neach article and additionally attempts to identify the verb introducing the quote to help lend \nadditional context, separating “John retorted…” from “John agreed…” to show whether the \nspeaker was agreeing with or rejecting the statement being made.  Each quoted statement is \nseparated by a “#” character, and within each block the following fields appear, separated by \npipe (“|”) symbols: \no Offset.  This is the character offset of the quoted statement within the document, \nindicating approximately where it was found in the body.  This can be used to associate \nthe date with the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest \nproximity to it. \no Length.  This is the length of the quoted statement in characters. \no Verb.  This is the verb used to introduce the quote, allowing for separation of \nagreement versus disagreement quotes.  May not be present for all quotes and not all \nverbs are recognized for this field. \no Quote.  The actual quotation itself. \n \nV2.1ALLNAMES.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This field contains \na list of all proper names referenced in the document, along with the character offsets of \napproximately where in the document they were found.  Unlike the V2ENHANCEDPERSONS and \nV2ENHANCEDORGANIZATIONS fields, which are restricted to person and organization names, \nrespectively, this field records ALL proper names referenced in the article, ranging from named \nevents like the Orange Revolution, Umbrella Movement, and Arab Spring, to movements like the \nCivil Rights Movement, to festivals and occurrences like the Cannes Film Festival and World Cup, \nto named wars like World War I, to named dates like Martin Luther King Day and Holocaust \nRemembrance Day, to named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act \nand Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  This field goes beyond people and organizations to \ncapturing a much broader view of the named events, objects, initiatives, laws, and other types \nof names in each article.  Each name reference is separated by a semicolon, and within each \nreference, the name is specified first, followed by a comma, and then the approximate character \noffset of the reference of that name in the document, allowing it to be associated with other \nentries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appear in closest proximity to it.  If a name is \nmentioned multiple times in a document, each mention will appear separately in this field.  This \nfield is designed to be maximally inclusive and in cases of ambiguity, to err on the side of \ninclusion of a name. \n \nV2.1AMOUNTS.

{"page_content": "offsets of approximately where in the document they were found.  Its primary role is to allow \nfor rapid numeric assessment of evolving situations (such as mentions of everything from the \nnumber of affected households to the estimated dollar amount of damage to the number of \nrelief trucks and troops being sent into the area, to the price of food and medicine in the \naffected zone) and general assessment of geographies and topics.  Both textual and numeric \nformats are supported (“twenty-five trucks”, “two million displaced civilians”, “hundreds of \nmillions of dollars”, “$1.25 billion was spent”, “75 trucks were dispatched”, “1,345 houses were \naffected”, “we spent $25m on it”, etc).  At this time, percentages are not supported due to the \nlarge amount of additional document context required for meaningful deciphering (“reduced by \n45%” is meaningless without understanding what was reduced and whether the reduction was \ngood or bad, often requiring looking across the entire enclosing paragraph for context).  This \nfield is designed to be maximally inclusive and in cases of ambiguity, to err on the side of \ninclusion of an amount even if the object of the amount is more difficult to decipher. \no Amount.  This is the precise numeric value of the amount.  Embedded commas are \nremoved (“1,345,123” becomes 1345123), but decimal numbers are left as is (thus this \nfield can range from a floating point number to a “long long” integer).  Numbers in \ntextual or mixed numeric-textual format (“such as “2m” or “two million” or “tens of \nmillions”) are converted to numeric digit representation. \no Object.  This is the object that the amount is of or refers to.  Thus, “20,000 combat \nsoldiers” will result in “20000” in the Amount field and “combat soldiers” in this field. \no Offset.  This is the character offset of the quoted statement within the document, \nindicating approximately where it was found in the body.  This can be used to associate \nthe date with the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest \nproximity to it. \n \nV2.1TRANSLATIONINFO.  (semicolon-delimited fields) This field is used to record provenance \ninformation for machine translated documents indicating the original source language and the \ncitation of the translation system used to translate the document for processing.  It will be blank \nfor documents originally in English.  At this time the field will also be blank for documents \ntranslated by a human translator and provided to GDELT in English (such as BBC Monitoring \nmaterials) – in future this field may be expanded to include information on human translation \npipelines, but at present it only captures information on machine translated materials.  An \nexample of the contents of this field might be “srclc:fra; eng:Moses 2.1.1 / MosesCore Europarl \nfr-en / GT-FRA 1.0”. \no SRCLC. This is the Source Language Code, representing the three-letter ISO639-2 code of \nthe language of the original source material.   \no ENG.  This is a textual citation string that indicates the engine(s) and model(s) used to \ntranslate the text.  The format of this field will vary across engines and over time and no \nexpectations should be made on the ordering or formatting of this field.  In the example \nabove, the string “Moses 2.1.1 / MosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0” indicates that \nthe document was translated using version 2.1.1 of the Moses 9 SMT platform, using the \n“MosesCore Europarl fr-en” translation and language models, with the final translation \nenhanced via GDELT Translingual’s own version 1.0 French translation and language \nmodels.  A value of “GT-ARA 1.0” indicates that GDELT Translingual’s version 1.0 Arabic \ntranslation and language models were the sole resources used for translation.  \nAdditional language systems used in the translation pipeline such as word segmentation \nsystems are also captured in this field such that a value of “GT-ZHO 1.0 / Stanford PKU” \n                                                          \n9 http://www.statmt.org/moses/", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-03-01T13:37:31-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/gdelt-gkg-2-1.pdf", "total_pages": 15, "format": "PDF 1.6", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2025-02-01T02:11:47-08:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20250201021147-08'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150301133731-05'00'", "page": 13}}

{"page_content": "THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "total_pages": 11, "format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "page": 0}}
{"page_content": "EVENT TABLE \n \nEVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe first few fields of an event record capture its globally unique identifier number, the date the event \ntook place on, and several alternatively formatted versions of the date designed to make it easier to \nwork with the event records in different analytical software programs that may have specific date \nformat requirements.  The parenthetical after each variable name gives the datatype of that field. \n \nNote that even though GDELT 2.0 operates at a 15 minute resolution, the date fields in this section still \nrecord the date at the daily level, since this is the resolution that event analysis has historically been \nperformed at.  To examine events at the 15 minute resolution, use the DATEADDED field (the second \nfrom the last field in this table at the end).  \n \n \nGlobalEventID.  (integer) Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely \nidentifies it in the master dataset.  NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is \nNOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields \nshould be used for this.  NOTE: There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 \nand February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0 – these are not missing events, the ID \nsequence was simply reset at a higher number so that it is possible to easily distinguish events \ncreated after the switchover to GDELT 2.0 from those created using the older GDELT 1.0 system. \n \nDay.  (integer) Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.  See DATEADDED field for \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS date. \n \nMonthYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYYMM format. \n \nYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYY format. \n \nFractionDate.  (floating point) Alternative formatting of the event date, computed as YYYY.FFFF, \nwhere FFFF is the percentage of the year completed by that day.  This collapses the month and \nday into a fractional range from 0 to 0.9999, capturing the 365 days of the year.  The fractional \ncomponent (FFFF) is computed as (MONTH * 30 + DAY) / 365.  This is an approximation and does \nnot correctly take into account the differing numbers of days in each month or leap years, but \noffers a simple single-number sorting mechanism for applications that wish to estimate the \nrough temporal distance between dates. \n \n \nACTOR ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe next fields describe attributes and characteristics of the two actors involved in the event.  This \nincludes the complete raw CAMEO code for each actor, its proper name, and associated attributes.  The \nraw CAMEO code for each actor contains an array of coded attributes indicating geographic, ethnic, and \nreligious affiliation and the actor’s role in the environment (political elite, military officer, rebel, etc).  \nThese 3-character codes may be combined in any order and are concatenated together to form the final \nraw actor CAMEO code.  To make it easier to utilize this information in analysis, this section breaks these \ncodes out into a set of individual fields that can be separately queried.  NOTE: all attributes in this \nsection other than CountryCode are derived from the TABARI ACTORS dictionary and are NOT \nsupplemented from information in the text.  Thus, if the text refers to a group as “Radicalized", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "total_pages": 11, "format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "page": 1}}
{"page_content": "terrorists,” but the TABARI ACTORS dictionary labels that group as “Insurgents,” the latter label will be \nused. Use the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph to enrich actors with additional information from the rest \nof the article.  NOTE: the CountryCode field reflects a combination of information from the TABARI \nACTORS dictionary and text, with the ACTORS dictionary taking precedence, and thus if the text refers to \n“French Assistant Minister Smith was in Moscow,” the CountryCode field will list France in the \nCountryCode field, while the geographic fields discussed at the end of this manual may list Moscow as \nhis/her location.  NOTE: One of the two actor fields may be blank in complex or single-actor situations or \nmay contain only minimal detail for actors such as “Unidentified gunmen.” \n \nGDELT currently uses the CAMEO version 1.1b3 taxonomy.  For more information on what each specific \ncode in the fields below stands for and the complete available taxonomy of the various fields below, \nplease see the CAMEO User Manual 1 or the GDELT website for crosswalk files.2 \n \n \nActor1Code.  (string) The complete raw CAMEO code for Actor1 (includes geographic, class, \nethnic, religious, and type classes).  May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1. \n \nActor1Name.  (string) The actual name of the Actor1.  In the case of a political leader or \norganization, this will be the leader’s formal name (GEORGE W BUSH, UNITED NATIONS), for a \ngeographic match it will be either the country or capital/major city name (UNITED STATES / \nPARIS), and for ethnic, religious, and type matches it will reflect the root match class (KURD, \nCATHOLIC, POLICE OFFICER, etc).  May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1. \n \nActor1CountryCode.  (string) The 3-character CAMEO code for the country affiliation of Actor1.  \nMay be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1 or determine its country affiliation \n(such as “UNIDENTIFIED GUNMEN”). \n \nActor1KnownGroupCode. (string) If Actor1 is a known IGO/NGO/rebel organization (United \nNations, World Bank, al-Qaeda, etc) with its own CAMEO code, this field will contain that code. \n \nActor1EthnicCode.  (string) If the source document specifies the ethnic affiliation of Actor1 and \nthat ethnic group has a CAMEO entry, the CAMEO code is entered here.  NOTE: a few special \ngroups like ARAB may also have entries in the type column due to legacy CAMEO behavior.  \nNOTE: this behavior is highly experimental and may not capture all affiliations properly – for \nmore comprehensive and sophisticated identification of ethnic affiliation, it is recommended \nthat users use the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph’s ethnic, religious, and social group \ntaxonomies and post-enrich actors from the GKG. \n \nActor1Religion1Code. (string) If the source document specifies the religious affiliation of Actor1 \nand that religious group has a CAMEO entry, the CAMEO code is entered here.  NOTE: a few \nspecial groups like JEW may also have entries in the geographic or type columns due to legacy \nCAMEO behavior.  NOTE: this behavior is highly experimental and may not capture all affiliations \nproperly – for more comprehensive and sophisticated identification of ethnic affiliation, it is \nrecommended that users use the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph’s ethnic, religious, and social \ngroup taxonomies and post-enrich actors from the GKG. \n \nActor1Religion2Code.  (string) If multiple religious codes are specified for Actor1, this contains \nthe secondary code.  Some religion entries automatically use two codes, such as Catholic, which \ninvokes Christianity as Code1 and Catholicism as Code2. \n \nActor1Type1Code.  (string) The 3-character CAMEO code of the CAMEO “type” or “role” of \nActor1, if specified.  This can be a specific role such as Police Forces, Government, Military, \nPolitical Opposition, Rebels, etc, a broad role class such as Education, Elites, Media, Refugees, or \n                                                          \n1 http://gdeltproject.org/data/documentation/CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3.pdf  \n2 http://gdeltproject.org/", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "total_pages": 11, "format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "page": 2}}
{"page_content": "organizational classes like Non-Governmental Movement.  Special codes such as Moderate and \nRadical may refer to the operational strategy of a group. \n \nActor1Type2Code.  (string) If multiple type/role codes are specified for Actor1, this returns the \nsecond code. \n \nActor1Type3Code.  (string) If multiple type/role codes are specified for Actor1, this returns the \nthird code. \n \nThe fields above are repeated for Actor2.  The set of fields above are repeated, but each is prefaced with \n“Actor2” instead of “Actor1”.  The definitions and values of each field are the same as above. \n \n \nEVENT ACTION ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe following fields break out various attributes of the event “action” (what Actor1 did to Actor2) and \noffer several mechanisms for assessing the “importance” or immediate-term “impact” of an event.  \nNOTE: the various fields in this section recording the amount of coverage an event has received are \nincluded solely for legacy purposes – the new Mentions table should be used instead in most cases. \n \n \nIsRootEvent.  (integer) The system codes every event found in an entire document, using an \narray of techniques to deference and link information together.  A number of previous projects \nsuch as the ICEWS initiative have found that events occurring in the lead paragraph of a \ndocument tend to be the most “important.”  This flag can therefore be used as a proxy for the \nrough importance of an event to create subsets of the event stream.  NOTE: this field refers only \nto the first news report to mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a \ndifferent context in other news reports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise \ninformation on the positioning of an event, see the Mentions table. \n \nEventCode.  (string) This is the raw CAMEO action code describing the action that Actor1 \nperformed upon Actor2.  NOTE: it is strongly recommended that this field be stored as a string \ninstead of an integer, since the CAMEO taxonomy can include zero-leaded event codes that can \nmake distinguishing between certain event types more difficult when stored as an integer. \n \nEventBaseCode.  (string) CAMEO event codes are defined in a three-level taxonomy.  For events \nat level three in the taxonomy, this yields its level two leaf root node.  For example, code “0251” \n(“Appeal for easing of administrative sanctions”) would yield an EventBaseCode of “025” \n(“Appeal to yield”).  This makes it possible to aggregate events at various resolutions of \nspecificity.  For events at levels two or one, this field will be set to EventCode.  NOTE: it is \nstrongly recommended that this field be stored as a string instead of an integer, since the \nCAMEO taxonomy can include zero-leaded event codes that can make distinguishing between \ncertain event types more difficult when stored as an integer. \n \nEventRootCode.  (string) Similar to EventBaseCode, this defines the root-level category the \nevent code falls under.  For example, code “0251” (“Appeal for easing of administrative \nsanctions”) has a root code of “02” (“Appeal”).  This makes it possible to aggregate events at \nvarious resolutions of specificity.  For events at levels two or one, this field will be set to \nEventCode.  NOTE: it is strongly recommended that this field be stored as a string instead of an \ninteger, since the CAMEO taxonomy can include zero-leaded event codes that can make \ndistinguishing between certain event types more difficult when stored as an integer. \n \nQuadClass.  (integer) The entire CAMEO event taxonomy is ultimately organized under four \nprimary classifications: Verbal Cooperation, Material Cooperation, Verbal Conflict, and Material", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "total_pages": 11, "format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "page": 3}}
{"page_content": "Conflict.  This field specifies this primary classification for the event type, allowing analysis at the \nhighest level of aggregation.  The numeric codes in this field map to the Quad Classes as follows: \n1=Verbal Cooperation, 2=Material Cooperation, 3=Verbal Conflict, 4=Material Conflict. \n \nGoldsteinScale.  (floating point) Each CAMEO event code is assigned a numeric score from -10 to \n+10, capturing the theoretical potential impact that type of event will have on the stability of a \ncountry.  This is known as the Goldstein Scale.  This field specifies the Goldstein score for each \nevent type.  NOTE: this score is based on the type of event, not the specifics of the actual event \nrecord being recorded – thus two riots, one with 10 people and one with 10,000, will both \nreceive the same Goldstein score.  This can be aggregated to various levels of time resolution to \nyield an approximation of the stability of a location over time. \n \nNumMentions.  (integer) This is the total number of mentions of this event across all source \ndocuments during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.  Multiple references to an \nevent within a single document also contribute to this count.  This can be used as a method of \nassessing the “importance” of an event: the more discussion of that event, the more likely it is \nto be significant.  The total universe of source documents and the density of events within them \nvary over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other \nmeasure of the universe of events during the time period of interest.  This field is actually a \ncomposite score of the total number of raw mentions and the number of mentions extracted \nfrom reprocessed versions of each article (see the discussion for the Mentions table).   NOTE: \nthis field refers only to the first news report to mention an event and is not updated if the event \nis found in a different context in other news reports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for \nmore precise information on the positioning of an event, see the Mentions table.  \n \nNumSources.  (integer) This is the total number of information sources containing one or more \nmentions of this event during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.  This can be used \nas a method of assessing the “importance” of an event: the more discussion of that event, the \nmore likely it is to be significant.  The total universe of sources varies over time, so it is \nrecommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of \nevents during the time period of interest.  NOTE: this field refers only to the first news report to \nmention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context in other news \nreports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the positioning of \nan event, see the Mentions table. \n \nNumArticles.  (integer) This is the total number of source documents containing one or more \nmentions of this event during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.  This can be used \nas a method of assessing the “importance” of an event: the more discussion of that event, the \nmore likely it is to be significant.  The total universe of source documents varies over time, so it \nis recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe \nof events during the time period of interest.  NOTE: this field refers only to the first news report \nto mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context in other news \nreports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the positioning of \nan event, see the Mentions table. \n \nAvgTone.  (numeric) This is the average “tone” of all documents containing one or more \nmentions of this event during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.  The score \nranges from -100 (extremely negative) to +100 (extremely positive).  Common values range \nbetween -10 and +10, with 0 indicating neutral.  This can be used as a method of filtering the \n“context” of events as a subtle measure of the importance of an event and as a proxy for the \n“impact” of that event.  For example, a riot event with a slightly negative average tone is likely \nto have been a minor occurrence, whereas if it had an extremely negative average tone, it \nsuggests a far more serious occurrence.  A riot with a positive score likely suggests a very minor", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "total_pages": 11, "format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "page": 4}}
{"page_content": "occurrence described in the context of a more positive narrative (such as a report of an attack \noccurring in a discussion of improving conditions on the ground in a country and how the \nnumber of attacks per day has been greatly reduced).  NOTE: this field refers only to the first \nnews report to mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context \nin other news reports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the \npositioning of an event, see the Mentions table.  NOTE: this provides only a basic tonal \nassessment of an article and it is recommended that users interested in emotional measures use \nthe Mentions and Global Knowledge Graph tables to merge the complete set of 2,300 emotions \nand themes from the GKG GCAM system into their analysis of event records. \n \nEVENT GEOGRAPHY \n \nThe final set of fields add a novel enhancement to the CAMEO taxonomy, georeferencing each event \nalong three primary dimensions to the landmark-centroid level.  To do this, the fulltext of the source \ndocument is processed using fulltext geocoding and automatic disambiguation to identify every \ngeographic reference.3  The closest reference to each of the two actors and to the action reference are \nthen encoded in these fields.  The georeferenced location for an actor may not always match the \nActor1_CountryCode or Actor2_CountryCode field, such as in a case where the President of Russia is \nvisiting Washington, DC in the United States, in which case the Actor1_CountryCode would contain the \ncode for Russia, while the georeferencing fields below would contain a match for Washington, DC.  It \nmay not always be possible for the system to locate a match for each actor or location, in which case \none or more of the fields may be blank.  The Action fields capture the location information closest to the \npoint in the event description that contains the actual statement of action and is the best location to use \nfor placing events on a map or in other spatial context.   \n \nTo find all events located in or relating to a specific city or geographic landmark, the Geo_FeatureID \ncolumn should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column.  This is because the Geo_Fullname \ncolumn captures the name of the location as expressed in the text and thus reflects differences in \ntransliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for the same location.  For example, Mecca \nis often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly spelled Jiddah or Jaddah.  The Geo_Fullname column \nwill reflect each of these different spellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the \nsame unique GNS or GNIS feature identification number.  For more information on the GNS and GNIS \nidentifiers, see Leetaru (2012). 4 \n \nWhen looking for events in or relating to a specific country, such as Syria, there are two possible filtering \nmethods.  The first is to use the Actor_CountryCode fields in the Actor section to look for all actors \nhaving the SYR (Syria) code.  However, conflict zones are often accompanied by high degrees of \nuncertainty in media reporting and a news article might mention only “Unidentified gunmen stormed a \nhouse and shot 12 civilians.”  In this case, the Actor_CountryCode fields for Actor1 and Actor2 would \nboth be blank, since the article did not specify the actor country affiliations, while their \nGeo_CountryCode values (and the ActorGeo_CountryCode for the event) would specify Syria.  This can \nresult in dramatic differences when examining active conflict zones.  The second method is to examine \nthe ActorGeo_CountryCode for the location of the event.  This will also capture situations such as the \nUnited States criticizing a statement by Russia regarding a specific Syrian attack. \n \n                                                          \n3 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n4 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "total_pages": 11, "format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "page": 5}}
{"page_content": " \nActor1Geo_Type.  (integer) This field specifies the geographic resolution of the match type and \nholds one of the following values:  1=COUNTRY (match was at the country level), 2=USSTATE \n(match was to a US state), 3=USCITY (match was to a US city or landmark), 4=WORLDCITY \n(match was to a city or landmark outside the US), 5=WORLDSTATE (match was to an \nAdministrative Division 1 outside the US – roughly equivalent to a US state).  This can be used to \nfilter events by geographic specificity, for example, extracting only those events with a \nlandmark-level geographic resolution for mapping.  Note that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), \n2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still provide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the \ncentroid of that country or state, but the FeatureID field below will be blank. \n \nActor1Geo_Fullname.  (string) This is the full human-readable name of the matched location.  In \nthe case of a country it is simply the country name.  For US and World states it is in the format of \n“State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the format of “City/Landmark, State, \nCountry”.  This can be used to label locations when placing events on a map.  NOTE: this field \nreflects the precise name used to refer to the location in the text itself, meaning it may contain \nmultiple spellings of the same location – use the FeatureID column to determine whether two \nlocation names refer to the same place. \n \nActor1Geo_CountryCode.  (string) This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code for the location. \n \nActor1Geo_ADM1Code.  (string). This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code followed by the \n2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code for the administrative division \nhousing the landmark.  In the case of the United States, this is the 2-character shortform of the \nstate’s name (such as “TX” for Texas). \n \nActor1Geo_ADM2Code.  (string).  For international locations this is the numeric Global \nAdministrative Unit Layers (GAUL) administrative division 2 (ADM2) code assigned to each global \nlocation, while for US locations this is the two-character shortform of the state’s name (such as \n“TX” for Texas) followed by the 3-digit numeric county code (following the INCITS 31:200x \nstandard used in GNIS).  For more detail on the contents and computation of this field, please \nsee the following footnoted URL. 5  NOTE:  This field may be blank/null in cases where no ADM2 \ninformation was available, for some ADM1-level matches, and for all country-level matches.  \nNOTE: this field may still contain a value for ADM1-level matches depending on how they are \ncodified in GNS. \n \nActor1Geo_Lat.  (floating point) This is the centroid latitude of the landmark for mapping. \n \nActor1Geo_Long.  (floating point) This is the centroid longitude of the landmark for mapping. \n \nActor1Geo_FeatureID.  (string). This is the GNS or GNIS FeatureID for this location.  More \ninformation on these values can be found in Leetaru (2012).6  NOTE: When Actor1Geo_Type has \na value of 3 or 4 this field will contain a signed numeric value, while it will contain a textual \nFeatureID in the case of other match resolutions (usually the country code or country code and \nADM1 code).  A small percentage of small cities and towns may have a blank value in this field \neven for Actor1Geo_Type values of 3 or 4: this will be corrected in the 2.0 release of GDELT.  \nNOTE: This field can contain both positive and negative numbers, see Leetaru (2012) for more \ninformation on this. \n \nThese codes are repeated for Actor2 and Action, using those prefixes. \n \nDATA MANAGEMENT FIELDS \n \n                                                          \n5 http://blog.gdeltproject.org/global-second-order-administrative-divisions-now-available-from-gaul/ \n6 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "total_pages": 11, "format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "page": 6}}
{"page_content": "Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field", "metadata": {"producer": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creator": "Microsoft® Word 2010", "creationdate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "source": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "file_path": "/home/donbr/don-aie-cohort8/gdelt-knowledge-base/data/raw/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf", "total_pages": 11, "format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "", "author": "Kalev Leetaru", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2015-02-19T13:39:50-05:00", "trapped": "", "modDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "creationDate": "D:20150219133950-05'00'", "page": 7}}

(integer)  This is the ID of the event that was mentioned in the article. \n \nEventTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the \nevent being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT (the DATEADDED field of the original event \nrecord).  This field can be compared against the next one to identify events being mentioned for \nthe first time (their first mentions) or to identify events of a particular vintage being mentioned \nnow (such as filtering for mentions of events at least one week old). \n \nMentionTimeDate.

NOTE:  Machine translation is often not as accurate as \nhuman translation and users requiring the highest possible confidence levels may wish to \nexclude events whose only mentions are in translated reports, while those needing the highest-\npossible coverage of the non-Western world will find that these events often offer the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or smaller-bore events of less interest to Western media.   \no SRCLC.
