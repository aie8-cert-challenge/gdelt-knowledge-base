How does Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improve question-answering when combined with knowledge graphs derived from the GDELT dataset?,"['Abstract In this work we study various Retrieval Augmented Regeneration (RAG) approaches to gain an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in a question-answering analysis. To gain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve information from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the relevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from the ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that while our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant subgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack consistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology and LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end. 1 Introduction In this work we study several approaches for communicating with a corpus of text via relevant text and knowledge graph (KG) representation and retrieval facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to understand the benefits and drawbacks of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches to corpus management and anlysis when combined with an LLM. Throughout we use as a case study a novel KG derived from the Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT)1 [13] dataset. As a way to enhance LLM outputs, researchers and practitioners have been quick in applying LLMs to query and understand proprietary data through retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) [14]. It has been shown that reasoning over the typical RAG framework, which only takes advantage of the unstructured text articles, fails to capture global information about the provided data [5, 27]. Motivated by this limitation, there has been recent interest in adapting these techniques to the case where our data has a graph structure, so that the LLM can directly ingest important relationships in the knowledge base [5, 7, 15, 31]. More specifically, KGs [8] are graph structures which are richly attributed with typing and semantic information on both nodes and edges. KG techniques provide ways to automatically query and extract information stored in a KG without the user explicitly needing to understand query languages to probe their knowledge base. Typically, these AI-based search algorithms find subgraphs that can be used to answer a user-provided query. The interactions between KGs and LLMs have potential beyond merely question-answering and knowledge extraction (see different research directions outlined by Pan et al. [18]). In particular, reflective of KGs being used to enhance LLM outputs, LLMs can be used to enhance existing KGs or create new ones entirely from scratch. However, exploration of techniques to this end either (1) do not deal with imposing different ontological structures in graph creation or (2) only focus on extracting ontological structures using LLMs 1https://www.gdeltproject.org/ 1']","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches improve question-answering by combining retrieval from unstructured text corpora with knowledge graph (KG) representations derived from the GDELT dataset. Traditional RAG methods use vector stores to retrieve relevant text, while more advanced approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to automatically construct KGs and retrieve relevant subgraphs. Ontology-based KGs created directly from GDELT use its underlying schema to form structured representations of global events, enabling direct graph queries and graph retrieval methods. Although ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, extracting relevant subgraphs automatically is challenging. LLM-generated KGs capture event summaries but often lack consistency and interpretability. Therefore, a synergistic approach combining ontology and LLM-based KG construction offers benefits for enhancing question-answering performance.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
How can Pythn be used to process and analyze the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) data effectively?,"['INTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.

How do contextual details in news articles get associated with unique record identifiers in the GKG system?,"['<1-hop>\n\nof contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and events driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context. However, with the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together. For example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all appeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in that article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, but there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional roles. GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article. While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new field allows for simple proximity-based contextualization. In the case of the example article above, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to the others. In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other connectivity can be explored. Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity indicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations. \uf0b7 Over 100 New GKG Themes. There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating oil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social issues like marginalization and burning in effigy. The list of recognized infectious diseases, ethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 global humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global currencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking species migration and poaching. \uf0b7 Extensible XML Block. GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for its source material. Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage across the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures. As GDELT encodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and government reports, additional types of information are available to codify. As a first example of this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion words of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and the Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East. Academic literature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the papers cited within that paper. This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation graphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts. Yet, such citation lists are unique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it would be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these kinds of specialized data types. Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called V2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are applicable only to subsets of the collection. Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode highly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \uf0b7', '<2-hop>\n\nUnique Record Identifiers. To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier. As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection. The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will make it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. 1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","The GKG system encodes contextual details from news by capturing people, organizations, locations, events, functional roles, and thematic context, and associates these data points using approximate character offsets within the original article to enable proximity-based contextualization.

How do the event record fields like DATEADDED and SOURCEURL complement the natural language processing techniques used in the Mentions table to improve event tracking in GDELT?,"['<1-hop>\n\nFinally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the event record. \uf0b7 DATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone. For those needing to access events at 15 minute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \uf0b7 SOURCEURL. (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this event in. In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and flow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first report, but is at least in the first few reports.', '<2-hop>\n\nMENTIONS TABLE The Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event table, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the global media system. Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an event which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table. Mentions are recorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a year ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical events being recontextualized into present actions. If a news report mentions multiple events, each mention is recorded separately in this table. For translated documents, all measures below are based on its English translation. Several of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events based on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event. When trying to understand news media spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background knowledge, and complex linguistic structures. Not every event mention will take the form of “American President Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, France.” Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris yesterday for a trade summit. The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on Ukraine.” To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer? Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on Ukraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or perhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy? While additional cues may be available in the surrounding text, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media. Similarly, it would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire world and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor. Even in the case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in Port-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this disambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity. GDELT makes use of an array of natural language processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context. While these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically complex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error. Under GDELT 1.0, the NumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents mentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to six revision passes. Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the Mentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field']","The event record fields such as DATEADDED and SOURCEURL provide essential data management information for each event record, with DATEADDED storing the precise timestamp when the event was added to the master database and SOURCEURL recording the URL or citation of the first news report found for the event.

Complementing this, the Mentions table in GDELT 2.0 uses advanced natural language processing techniques, including coreference resolution and deep parsing with whole-document context, to handle ambiguous and linguistically complex event mentions across global media. Each mention of an event is recorded separately, allowing detailed tracking of the event's trajectory and network structure.

The GKG system now processes every news report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \uf0b7 Relevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds. A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now specify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that represents the core focus of the article. GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats. In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \uf0b7 Quotes, Names, and Amounts. The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food prices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable item. GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to offer numeric context to global events. In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative. Finally, GDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the evolving language used by political leadership across the world. \uf0b7']","The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 applies a sophisticated array of natural language processing algorithms to each document, enabling it to compute codified metadata that captures latent and contextual dimensions of global news. These algorithms support the GKG's ability to connect people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions worldwide. Specifically, the GKG integrates the Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module, which represents one of the largest deployments of sentiment analysis globally. GCAM combines 24 emotional measurement packages to assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes in real time, across 15 languages natively, including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, and Spanish, among others. This multilingual sentiment analysis is further enhanced by GDELT Translingual, which translates news from 65 languages into English in real time, allowing the system to monitor global news comprehensively without language barriers. Together, these natural language processing and sentiment analysis capabilities open entirely new analytic opportunities, such as real-time measurement of emotional undercurrents on a planetary scale, tracking evolving language used by political leadership, and providing nuanced insights into global societal dynamics that precede physical events.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How does the Mentions table in GDELT 2.0 enhance tracking of event mentions compared to the previous NumMentions field, and what role do the themes 'Mentions' and 'Mentions table' play in this improvement?","['<1-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their descriptions. GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, capturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2. A wide array of variables break out the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, the Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique array of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both actors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the story of each event “in flight” through the global media system. At present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, however in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 format. The Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note that files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited). With the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at least through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without modification. Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning February 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches back to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. There are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset. The first is the traditional Event table. This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several changes as noted below. In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records all mentions of each event. As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those mentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, including the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus being buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event from that specific news report. The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it possible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases. Those wishing to find the earliest glimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of period “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest events with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the highest Confidence measures. This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each individual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below). It also makes it possible to identify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those with the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific source language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).', '<2-hop>\n\nMENTIONS TABLE The Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event table, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the global media system. Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an event which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table. Mentions are recorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a year ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical events being recontextualized into present actions. If a news report mentions multiple events, each mention is recorded separately in this table. For translated documents, all measures below are based on its English translation. Several of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events based on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event. When trying to understand news media spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background knowledge, and complex linguistic structures. Not every event mention will take the form of “American President Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, France.” Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris yesterday for a trade summit. The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on Ukraine.” To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer? Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on Ukraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or perhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy? While additional cues may be available in the surrounding text, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media. Similarly, it would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire world and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor. Even in the case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in Port-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this disambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity. GDELT makes use of an array of natural language processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context. While these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically complex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error. Under GDELT 1.0, the NumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents mentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to six revision passes. Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the Mentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field']","The Mentions table in GDELT 2.0 enhances tracking of event mentions by recording each individual mention of an event across multiple news reports, allowing for detailed tracing of the story's trajectory and network structure through the global media system. Unlike the previous NumMentions field in GDELT 1.0, which was a composite score combining the number of unique documents mentioning an event and the number of text revisions, the Mentions table separates these by listing each mention as a distinct record. This enables more precise filtering and analysis of event mentions, including the ability to track mentions irrespective of the original event date and to handle ambiguous references through advanced natural language processing. The themes 'Mentions' and 'Mentions table' are central to this improvement, as they highlight the new structure and functionality introduced in GDELT 2.0 that allow for more granular and dynamic interaction with event data.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

Only image-based embedded posts are included in this field – videos are identified in the following field. \uf0b7 V2.1SOCIALVIDEOEMBEDS. (semicolon-delimited list of URLs). News websites are increasingly embedding videos inline in their articles to illustrate them with realtime reaction or citizen reporting from the ground. Some news outlets that also have television properties may cross- link their television reporting into their web-based presentation. GDELT currently recognizes YouTube, DailyMotion, Vimeo, and Vine videos embedded in articles and records their URLs in this field. Similarly to the field above, this allows for a form of social media “curation” of the videos deemed by the mainstream media to be of greatest relevance, significance, credibly, and/or interest to their audiences. \uf0b7 V2.1QUOTATIONS. (pound-delimited (“#”) blocks, with pipe-delimited (“|”) fields). News coverage frequently features excerpted statements from participants in an event and/or those affected by it and these quotations can offer critical insights into differing perspectives and emotions surrounding that event. GDELT identifies and extracts all quoted statements from each article and additionally attempts to identify the verb introducing the quote to help lend additional context, separating “John retorted…” from “John agreed…” to show whether the speaker was agreeing with or rejecting the statement being made. Each quoted statement is separated by a “#” character, and within each block the following fields appear, separated by pipe (“|”) symbols: o Offset. This is the character offset of the quoted statement within the document, indicating approximately where it was found in the body. This can be used to associate the date with the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest proximity to it. o Length. This is the length of the quoted statement in characters. o Verb. This is the verb used to introduce the quote, allowing for separation of agreement versus disagreement quotes. May not be present for all quotes and not all verbs are recognized for this field. o Quote. The actual quotation itself. \uf0b7 V2.1ALLNAMES. (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields) This field contains a list of all proper names referenced in the document, along with the character offsets of approximately where in the document they were found. Unlike the V2ENHANCEDPERSONS and V2ENHANCEDORGANIZATIONS fields, which are restricted to person and organization names, respectively, this field records ALL proper names referenced in the article, ranging from named events like the Orange Revolution, Umbrella Movement, and Arab Spring, to movements like the Civil Rights Movement, to festivals and occurrences like the Cannes Film Festival and World Cup, to named wars like World War I, to named dates like Martin Luther King Day and Holocaust Remembrance Day, to named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative. This field goes beyond people and organizations to capturing a much broader view of the named events, objects, initiatives, laws, and other types of names in each article. Each name reference is separated by a semicolon, and within each reference, the name is specified first, followed by a comma, and then the approximate character offset of the reference of that name in the document, allowing it to be associated with other entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appear in closest proximity to it. If a name is mentioned multiple times in a document, each mention will appear separately in this field.

"How does the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph Version 2.1 improve upon version 1.0 by incorporating new features like date mentions and proximity context, and what implications do these changes have for users processing the data?","['<1-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', '<2-hop>\n\nDate Mentions.

Additionally, Version 2.1 introduces the Proximity Context capability, representing a significant change from version 1.0, enriching the overall format with more detailed contextual information. These enhancements expand the GKG's ability to capture latent dimensions of global human society beyond physical occurrences. However, due to the increased complexity and size of the data, users require more advanced text processing and scripting skills (e.g., in PERL or Python) to preprocess and reformat the data for statistical analysis.

How do the GNIS FeatureID and GIS location data complement each other in accurately identifying and mapping geographic locations?,"['<1-hop>\n\nproximity to it. If a theme is mentioned multiple times in a document, each mention will appear separately in this field. \uf0b7 V1LOCATIONS. (semicolon-delimited blocks, with pound symbol (“#”) delimited fields) This is a list of all locations found in the text, extracted through the Leetaru (2012) algorithm. 2 The algorithm is run in a more aggressive stance here than ordinary in order to extract every possible locative referent, so may have a slightly elevated level of false positives. NOTE: some locations have multiple accepted formal or informal names and this field is collapsed on name, rather than feature (since in some applications the understanding of a geographic feature differs based on which name was used to reference it). In cases where it is necessary to collapse by feature, the Geo_FeatureID column should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column. This is because the Geo_Fullname column captures the name of the location as expressed in the text and thus reflects differences in transliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for the same location. For example, Mecca is often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly spelled Jiddah or Jaddah. The Geo_Fullname column will reflect each of these different spellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the same unique GNS or GNIS feature identification number. For more information on the GNS and GNIS identifiers, see Leetaru (2012). 3 This field is identical in format and population as the corresponding field in the GKG 1.0 format. NOTE: there was an error in this field from 2/19/2015 through midday 3/1/2015 that caused the CountryCode field to list the wrong country code in some cases. o Location Type. (integer) This field specifies the geographic resolution of the match type and holds one of the following values: 1=COUNTRY (match was at the country level), 2=USSTATE (match was to a US state), 3=USCITY (match was to a US city or landmark), 4=WORLDCITY (match was to a city or landmark outside the US), 5=WORLDSTATE (match was to an Administrative Division 1 outside the US – roughly equivalent to a US state). This can be used to filter counts by geographic specificity, for example, extracting only those counts with a landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping. Note that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), 2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still provide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the centroid of that country or state, but the FeatureID field below will contain its textual country or ADM1 code instead of a numeric featureid. o Location FullName. (text) This is the full human-readable name of the matched location. In the case of a country it is simply the country name. For US and World states it is in the format of “State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the format of “City/Landmark, State, Country”. This can be used to label locations when placing counts on a map. Note: this field reflects the precise name used to refer to the location in the text itself, meaning it may contain multiple spellings of the same location – use the FeatureID column to determine whether two location names refer to the same place. o', '<2-hop>\n\nshortform of the state’s name (such as “TX” for Texas). Note: see the notice above for CountryCode regarding the FIPS10-4 / GENC transition. Note: to obtain ADM2 (district- level) assignments for locations, you can either perform a spatial join against a ShapeFile template in any GIS software, or cross-walk the FeatureID to the GNIS/GNS databases – this will provide additional fields such as ADM2 codes and MGRS grid references for GNS. o Location Latitude. (floating point number) This is the centroid latitude of the landmark for mapping. In the case of a country or administrative division this will reflect the centroid of that entire country/division. o Location Longitude. (floating point number) This is the centroid longitude of the landmark for mapping. In the case of a country or administrative division this will reflect the centroid of that entire country/division. o Location FeatureID. (text OR signed integer) This is the numeric GNS or GNIS FeatureID for this location OR a textual country or ADM1 code. More information on these values can be found in Leetaru (2012).4 Note: This field will be blank or contain a textual ADM1 code for country or ADM1-level matches – see above. Note: For numeric GNS or GNIS FeatureIDs, this field can contain both positive and negative numbers, see Leetaru (2012) for more information on this. \uf0b7 V2ENHANCEDLOCATIONS. (semicolon-delimited blocks, with pound symbol (“#”) delimited fields) This field is identical to the V1LOCATIONS field with the primary exception of an extra field appended to the end of each location block after its FeatureID that lists the approximate character offset of the reference to that location in the text. In addition, if a location appears multiple times in the article, it will be listed multiple times in this field. The only other modification from V1LOCATIONS is the addition of a single new field “Location ADM2Code” in between “Location ADM1Code” and “Location Latitude”. 5 NOTE: there was an error in this field from 2/19/2015 through midday 3/1/2015 that caused the CountryCode field to list the wrong country code in some cases. \uf0b7 V1PERSONS. (semicolon-delimited) This is the list of all person names found in the text, extracted through the Leetaru (2012) algorithm. 6 This name recognition algorithm is unique in that it is specially designed to recognize the African, Asian, and Middle Eastern names that yield significantly reduced accuracy with most name recognition engines.
