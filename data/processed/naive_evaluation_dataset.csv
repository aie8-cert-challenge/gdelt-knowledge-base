How is JSON related to the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) data format and what considerations should a data scientist keep in mind when working with it?,"['THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3', 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html', '[23, 28].\nThroughout this work we use the GDELT dataset as a case study.\nGDELT is a massive collection of\nnews reports that provide a real-time computational record of global events that is published every 15\nminutes. It aggregates information from various news sources, blogs, and social media platforms to construct\na large collection of data including information on people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions.\nEssentially, GDELT offers a snapshot of the world’s collective events, enabling researchers and analysts to\nexplore complex patterns and relationships within global society. By analyzing this data, it’s possible to\nidentify emerging trends, assess risks, understand public sentiment, and track the evolution of various issues\nover time. The applications of GDELT are diverse and far-reaching. Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT). But in fact GDELT-GKG2 is implemented as multiple\nlinked tables recording information about the relationship between articles and events, and thus effectively\nhas the structure of a relational database. Another important contribution of this paper is to actually realize\nGKG2 properly in the mathematical form of a KG, effectively a graph database, derived from and consistent\nwith its native relational database form. To facilitate this effort, we have identified a lightweight ontology\nfor GDELT in the form of its graph schema, realizing its relational database schema in a KG form.\nUsing the KG that we construct from the GDELT-GKG2 dataset, we provide a case study to explore the\nutility of LLM-based tools to extract information and confirm that the KG can be used for question-answering\nin cases where traditional RAG fails. As part of our analysis, we compare to KGs produced from processing\nvarious news articles with an LLM, prompting it to try and adhere to a reduced version of the same ontology.\nThe current state of neurosymbolic work is noted for the plethora of experimental architectures available.\nWhile details are explicated below in Section 3.2, we preview ours in Figure 1, including the five method-\nological pathways which are quantitatively compared: 1) graph queries on the KG (called the DKG) derived\n“directly” from GKG2; 2) use of G-Retriever2 [7] against the same DKG; 3) RAG against a vector store\nrepresentation of GKG2; 4) G-Retriever against a second KG (called the LKG) derived from using Llamain-\ndex3 [1] against the GDELT source articles; and 5) GraphRAG4 Q&A deployed against a third KG (called\nGRKG) using Microsoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters.\nFigure 1: Pipeline of different experiments ran to analyze the GDELT database using an LLM.\n2https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever\n3https://www.llamaindex.ai/\n4https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/\n2', 'Figure 3: GDELT GKG 2.0 ontology relating articles and events..\nMethods to automatically determine the graphical form of a relational database are widely known [21]. Most\nnaturally, consider a table T with m rows T[j], 1 ≤j ≤m and n columns T.i, 1 ≤i ≤n. Then each of the\nm rows T[j] is represented as a node in one meta-class labeled by the primary keys. This node then has n\noutgoing edges, each connecting to a node in another meta-class representing the field value T[j].i, and labeled\nby the column name. The resulting “star” bipartite graphs are then linked over shared values, including\nacross multiple tables. This method straightforwardly produces a graph schema consistent with a given\nRDB, which may or may not be of sufficient complexity to warrant the lofty description of “ontology”. In\nour case, such a straightforward approach is mostly warranted, although as we will see additional constraints\nin the event table will argue for a somewhat more specific and idosyncratic graph structure.\nAfter understanding the GDELT database schema, we developed a capability to convert (portions of) the\nGDELT database to a KG using an ontology as a graph typing schema, derived from the above relational\nschema. This is shown in Fig. 3, to be interpreted as follows:\n• Nodes in the ontology indicate the types of nodes possible in the KG.\n• Nodes are color-coded to indicate their source relational table.\n• Fields in ⟨angled brackets⟩indicate the field name in the schema.\n4']","['INTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day.

Instead, the GKG data is provided primarily in a tab-delimited CSV format, optimized for fast scanning and processing. The reason JSON (as well as XML, RDF, or other formats) is not used natively is due to the significant increase in on-disk footprint and complexity that these formats would introduce given the size and complexity of the GKG data.

However, users who require the GKG data in JSON or other formats can convert the native CSV format into JSON by writing scripts in languages such as Python or PERL. This conversion is feasible but requires additional preprocessing.

### Key considerations for a data scientist working with GKG data and JSON:

1. **Native Format and Conversion**:  
   - GKG data is natively in a tab-delimited CSV format, not JSON.  
   - JSON conversion is possible but not provided out-of-the-box due to size and complexity concerns.  
   - Data scientists should be prepared to write custom scripts to convert CSV to JSON if needed.

2. **Complexity and Size**:  
   - The GKG dataset is very large and complex, encoding a wide range of metadata about global news articles, events, people, organizations, locations, themes, and their relationships.  
   - JSON or XML formats would significantly increase storage requirements and potentially slow down processing.

3. **Preprocessing Requirements**:  
   - The GKG format requires sophisticated preprocessing before analysis.  
   - Users typically need advanced text processing and scripting skills (e.g., Python, PERL) to parse, extract, and reformat the data for use in statistical packages or graph databases.

4. **Data Structure and Relationships**:  
   - The GKG data is relational in nature, consisting of multiple linked tables (e.g., articles, mentions, events).  
   - When converting to JSON, careful attention must be paid to preserving these relationships (e.g., many-to-many links between articles and events via mentions).  
   - JSON representations should ideally reflect the relational schema or the knowledge graph structure to maintain data integrity.

5. **Use Case and Performance**:  
   - The CSV format is optimized for fast, parallelized streaming and parsing, which is important for handling the massive volume of data updated every 15 minutes.  
   - JSON may be less efficient for such large-scale streaming and real-time processing.

6. **Extensibility and Specialized Fields**:  
   - The GKG includes specialized fields such as an extensible XML block (V2EXTRASXML) for encoding additional metadata not common to all records.  
   - When converting to JSON, these specialized fields need to be handled appropriately, possibly as nested JSON objects or strings.

### Summary

- **JSON is related to GKG data as a possible but non-native format** that users can generate through custom scripting.  
- **Data scientists should be aware that GKG is provided in a tab-delimited CSV format optimized for performance and size**, and converting to JSON requires additional processing and careful handling of complex relational data.  
- **Advanced scripting and data processing skills are essential** to work effectively with GKG data, whether in its native format or converted to JSON.","The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) is primarily available in a tab-delimited CSV format rather than JSON due to the complexity and size of encoding it in JSON, XML, RDF, or other file formats, which significantly increases the on-disk footprint.

Wht is GDELT Translingual?,"['offsets of approximately where in the document they were found.  Its primary role is to allow \nfor rapid numeric assessment of evolving situations (such as mentions of everything from the \nnumber of affected households to the estimated dollar amount of damage to the number of \nrelief trucks and troops being sent into the area, to the price of food and medicine in the \naffected zone) and general assessment of geographies and topics.  Both textual and numeric \nformats are supported (“twenty-five trucks”, “two million displaced civilians”, “hundreds of \nmillions of dollars”, “$1.25 billion was spent”, “75 trucks were dispatched”, “1,345 houses were \naffected”, “we spent $25m on it”, etc).  At this time, percentages are not supported due to the \nlarge amount of additional document context required for meaningful deciphering (“reduced by \n45%” is meaningless without understanding what was reduced and whether the reduction was \ngood or bad, often requiring looking across the entire enclosing paragraph for context).  This \nfield is designed to be maximally inclusive and in cases of ambiguity, to err on the side of \ninclusion of an amount even if the object of the amount is more difficult to decipher. \no Amount.  This is the precise numeric value of the amount.  Embedded commas are \nremoved (“1,345,123” becomes 1345123), but decimal numbers are left as is (thus this \nfield can range from a floating point number to a “long long” integer).  Numbers in \ntextual or mixed numeric-textual format (“such as “2m” or “two million” or “tens of \nmillions”) are converted to numeric digit representation. \no Object.  This is the object that the amount is of or refers to.  Thus, “20,000 combat \nsoldiers” will result in “20000” in the Amount field and “combat soldiers” in this field. \no Offset.  This is the character offset of the quoted statement within the document, \nindicating approximately where it was found in the body.  This can be used to associate \nthe date with the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest \nproximity to it. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1TRANSLATIONINFO.  (semicolon-delimited fields) This field is used to record provenance \ninformation for machine translated documents indicating the original source language and the \ncitation of the translation system used to translate the document for processing.  It will be blank \nfor documents originally in English.  At this time the field will also be blank for documents \ntranslated by a human translator and provided to GDELT in English (such as BBC Monitoring \nmaterials) – in future this field may be expanded to include information on human translation \npipelines, but at present it only captures information on machine translated materials.  An \nexample of the contents of this field might be “srclc:fra; eng:Moses 2.1.1 / MosesCore Europarl \nfr-en / GT-FRA 1.0”. \no SRCLC. This is the Source Language Code, representing the three-letter ISO639-2 code of \nthe language of the original source material.   \no ENG.  This is a textual citation string that indicates the engine(s) and model(s) used to \ntranslate the text.  The format of this field will vary across engines and over time and no \nexpectations should be made on the ordering or formatting of this field.  In the example \nabove, the string “Moses 2.1.1 / MosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0” indicates that \nthe document was translated using version 2.1.1 of the Moses 9 SMT platform, using the \n“MosesCore Europarl fr-en” translation and language models, with the final translation \nenhanced via GDELT Translingual’s own version 1.0 French translation and language \nmodels.  A value of “GT-ARA 1.0” indicates that GDELT Translingual’s version 1.0 Arabic \ntranslation and language models were the sole resources used for translation.  \nAdditional language systems used in the translation pipeline such as word segmentation \nsystems are also captured in this field such that a value of “GT-ZHO 1.0 / Stanford PKU” \n                                                          \n9 http://www.statmt.org/moses/', 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array', 'the MentionIdentifier field above to merge the Mentions table with the GKG table to access the \ncomplete set of 2,300 emotions and themes from the GCAM system.    \n\uf0b7 \nMentionDocTranslationInfo.  (string)  This field is internally delimited by semicolons and is used \nto record provenance information for machine translated documents indicating the original \nsource language and the citation of the translation system used to translate the document for \nprocessing.  It will be blank for documents originally in English.  At this time the field will also be \nblank for documents translated by a human translator and provided to GDELT in English (such as \nBBC Monitoring materials) – in future this field may be expanded to include information on \nhuman translation pipelines, but at present it only captures information on machine translated \nmaterials.  An example of the contents of this field might be “srclc:fra; eng:Moses 2.1.1 / \nMosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0”.  NOTE:  Machine translation is often not as accurate as \nhuman translation and users requiring the highest possible confidence levels may wish to \nexclude events whose only mentions are in translated reports, while those needing the highest-\npossible coverage of the non-Western world will find that these events often offer the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or smaller-bore events of less interest to Western media.   \no SRCLC.

A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).', 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening entirely new analytic opportunities. Some of the most significant changes: \uf0b7 Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes. The GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment analysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual dimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, French, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Urdu). GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents and reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from LIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \uf0b7 Realtime Translation of 65 Languages. GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT Translingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine translation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, representing 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into English for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines. GDELT Translingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the very first glimpses of a world without language barriers. The GKG system now processes every news report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \uf0b7 Relevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds. A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now specify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that represents the core focus of the article. GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats. In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \uf0b7 Quotes, Names, and Amounts. The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food prices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable item. GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to offer numeric context to global events. In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative. Finally, GDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the evolving language used by political leadership across the world. \uf0b7']","GDELT Translingual is a component of the GDELT 2.0 system that provides realtime machine translation of global news from 65 languages into English. It represents what is believed to be the largest realtime streaming news machine translation deployment in the world. This allows GDELT to monitor nearly all non-English news coverage (98.4% of daily non-English volume) by translating it into English for processing through GDELT's event and content analysis pipelines.

Key features of GDELT Translingual include:

- Translating news from 65 languages in realtime.
- Enabling GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume without language barriers.
- Supporting the identification and tracking of people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across multiple languages and media systems.
- Providing provenance information about the machine translation, including the original source language and the translation engine/model used.

what is date mentions in news articles?,"['records GDELT’s confidence in its extraction of that event from that particular article.  This field is a \npercent, ranging from 10 to 100% and indicates how aggressively GDELT had to perform tasks like \ncoreference or grammatical restructuring to extract the event from that article.  Sorting all mentions of \nan event by this field makes it possible to identify articles featuring the strongest and most \nunambiguous discussion of an event. \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer)  This is the ID of the event that was mentioned in the article. \n\uf0b7 \nEventTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the \nevent being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT (the DATEADDED field of the original event \nrecord).  This field can be compared against the next one to identify events being mentioned for \nthe first time (their first mentions) or to identify events of a particular vintage being mentioned \nnow (such as filtering for mentions of events at least one week old). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) of the \ncurrent update.  This is identical for all entries in the update file but is included to make it easier \nto load the Mentions table into a database.   \n\uf0b7 \nMentionType.  (integer)  This is a numeric identifier that refers to the source collection the \ndocument came from and is used to interpret the MentionIdentifier in the next column.  In \nessence, it specifies how to interpret the MentionIdentifier to locate the actual document.  At \npresent, it can hold one of the following values: \no 1 = WEB (The document originates from the open web and the MentionIdentifier is a \nfully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web). \no 2 = CITATIONONLY (The document originates from a broadcast, print, or other offline \nsource in which only a textual citation is available for the document.  In this case the \nMentionIdentifier contains the textual citation for the document). \no 3 = CORE (The document originates from the CORE archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the CORE \nwebsite). \no 4 = DTIC (The document originates from the DTIC archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the DTIC website). \no 5 = JSTOR (The document originates from the JSTOR archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through your JSTOR \nsubscription if your institution subscribes to it). \no 6 = NONTEXTUALSOURCE (The document originates from a textual proxy (such as closed \ncaptioning) of a non-textual information source (such as a video) available via a URL and \nthe MentionIdentifier provides the URL of the non-textual original source.  At present, \nthis Collection Identifier is used for processing of the closed captioning streams of the \nInternet Archive Television News Archive in which each broadcast is available via a URL, \nbut the URL offers access only to the video of the broadcast and does not provide any \naccess to the textual closed captioning used to generate the metadata.  This code is \nused in order to draw a distinction between URL-based textual material (Collection \nIdentifier 1 (WEB) and URL-based non-textual material like the Television News Archive). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionSourceName.  (integer)  This is a human-friendly identifier of the source of the \ndocument.  For material originating from the open web with a URL this field will contain the top-\nlevel domain the page was from.  For BBC Monitoring material it will contain “BBC Monitoring” \nand for JSTOR material it will contain “JSTOR.”  This field is intended for human display of major \nsources as well as for network analysis of information flows by source, obviating the \nrequirement to perform domain or other parsing of the MentionIdentifier field.', 'Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field', 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.', '\uf0b7 \nMentionIdentifier.  (integer)  This is the unique external identifier for the source document.  It \ncan be used to uniquely identify the document and access it if you have the necessary \nsubscriptions or authorizations and/or the document is public access.  This field can contain a \nrange of values, from URLs of open web resources to textual citations of print or broadcast \nmaterial to DOI identifiers for various document repositories.  For example, if MentionType is \nequal to 1, this field will contain a fully-qualified URL suitable for direct access.  If MentionType \nis equal to 2, this field will contain a textual citation akin to what would appear in an academic \njournal article referencing that document (NOTE that the actual citation format will vary (usually \nbetween APA, Chicago, Harvard, or MLA) depending on a number of factors and no assumptions \nshould be made on its precise format at this time due to the way in which this data is currently \nprovided to GDELT – future efforts will focus on normalization of this field to a standard citation \nformat).  If MentionType is 3, the field will contain a numeric or alpha-numeric DOI that can be \ntyped into JSTOR’s search engine to access the document if your institution has a JSTOR \nsubscription. \n\uf0b7 \nSentenceID.  (integer)  The sentence within the article where the event was mentioned (starting \nwith the first sentence as 1, the second sentence as 2, the third sentence as 3, and so on).  This \ncan be used similarly to the CharOffset fields below, but reports the event’s location in the \narticle in terms of sentences instead of characters, which is more amenable to certain measures \nof the “importance” of an event’s positioning within an article. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1CharOffset.  (integer)  The location within the article (in terms of English characters) \nwhere Actor1 was found.  This can be used in combination with the GKG or other analysis to \nidentify further characteristics and attributes of the actor.  NOTE: due to processing performed \non each article, this may be slightly offset from the position seen when the article is rendered in \na web browser. \n\uf0b7 \nActor2CharOffset.  (integer)  The location within the article (in terms of English characters) \nwhere Actor2 was found.  This can be used in combination with the GKG or other analysis to \nidentify further characteristics and attributes of the actor.  NOTE: due to processing performed \non each article, this may be slightly offset from the position seen when the article is rendered in \na web browser. \n\uf0b7 \nActionCharOffset.  (integer)  The location within the article (in terms of English characters) \nwhere the core Action description was found.  This can be used in combination with the GKG or \nother analysis to identify further characteristics and attributes of the actor.  NOTE: due to \nprocessing performed on each article, this may be slightly offset from the position seen when \nthe article is rendered in a web browser. \n\uf0b7 \nInRawText.  (integer)  This records whether the event was found in the original unaltered raw \narticle text (a value of 1) or whether advanced natural language processing algorithms were \nrequired to synthesize and rewrite the article text to identify the event (a value of 0).  See the \ndiscussion on the Confidence field below for more details.  Mentions with a value of “1” in this \nfield likely represent strong detail-rich references to an event. \n\uf0b7 \nConfidence.  (integer)  Percent confidence in the extraction of this event from this article.  See \nthe discussion above. \n\uf0b7 \nMentionDocLen.  (integer)  The length in English characters of the source document (making it \npossible to filter for short articles focusing on a particular event versus long summary articles \nthat casually mention an event in passing). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionDocTone.  (integer)  The same contents as the AvgTone field in the Events table, but \ncomputed for this particular article.  NOTE: users interested in emotional measures should use', 'significance, credibly, and/or interest to their audiences.  Only image-based embedded posts are \nincluded in this field – videos are identified in the following field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SOCIALVIDEOEMBEDS.    (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News websites are increasingly \nembedding videos inline in their articles to illustrate them with realtime reaction or citizen \nreporting from the ground.  Some news outlets that also have television properties may cross-\nlink their television reporting into their web-based presentation.  GDELT currently recognizes \nYouTube, DailyMotion, Vimeo, and Vine videos embedded in articles and records their URLs in \nthis field.  Similarly to the field above, this allows for a form of social media “curation” of the \nvideos deemed by the mainstream media to be of greatest relevance, significance, credibly, \nand/or interest to their audiences.   \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1QUOTATIONS.  (pound-delimited (“#”) blocks, with pipe-delimited (“|”) fields).  News \ncoverage frequently features excerpted statements from participants in an event and/or those \naffected by it and these quotations can offer critical insights into differing perspectives and \nemotions surrounding that event.  GDELT identifies and extracts all quoted statements from \neach article and additionally attempts to identify the verb introducing the quote to help lend \nadditional context, separating “John retorted…” from “John agreed…” to show whether the \nspeaker was agreeing with or rejecting the statement being made.  Each quoted statement is \nseparated by a “#” character, and within each block the following fields appear, separated by \npipe (“|”) symbols: \no Offset.  This is the character offset of the quoted statement within the document, \nindicating approximately where it was found in the body.  This can be used to associate \nthe date with the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest \nproximity to it. \no Length.  This is the length of the quoted statement in characters. \no Verb.  This is the verb used to introduce the quote, allowing for separation of \nagreement versus disagreement quotes.  May not be present for all quotes and not all \nverbs are recognized for this field. \no Quote.  The actual quotation itself. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1ALLNAMES.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This field contains \na list of all proper names referenced in the document, along with the character offsets of \napproximately where in the document they were found.  Unlike the V2ENHANCEDPERSONS and \nV2ENHANCEDORGANIZATIONS fields, which are restricted to person and organization names, \nrespectively, this field records ALL proper names referenced in the article, ranging from named \nevents like the Orange Revolution, Umbrella Movement, and Arab Spring, to movements like the \nCivil Rights Movement, to festivals and occurrences like the Cannes Film Festival and World Cup, \nto named wars like World War I, to named dates like Martin Luther King Day and Holocaust \nRemembrance Day, to named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act \nand Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  This field goes beyond people and organizations to \ncapturing a much broader view of the named events, objects, initiatives, laws, and other types \nof names in each article.  Each name reference is separated by a semicolon, and within each \nreference, the name is specified first, followed by a comma, and then the approximate character \noffset of the reference of that name in the document, allowing it to be associated with other \nentries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appear in closest proximity to it.  If a name is \nmentioned multiple times in a document, each mention will appear separately in this field.  This \nfield is designed to be maximally inclusive and in cases of ambiguity, to err on the side of \ninclusion of a name. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1AMOUNTS.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This field contains \na list of all precise numeric amounts referenced in the document, along with the character']","['Date Mentions. We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references found in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates as possible “anniversary violence” indicators. All day, month, and year dates are now extracted from each document. \uf0b7 Proximity Context. Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the introduction of the new Proximity Context capability. The GKG records an enormously rich array']","The date mentioned in news articles, as recorded in the GDELT data, is represented primarily by the following fields:

1. **EventTimeDate**: This is a 15-minute timestamp (in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) indicating when the event being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT. It corresponds to the date and time the event originally occurred or was first added to the database.

2. **MentionTimeDate**: This is also a 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) representing the time of the current update or mention of the event in the news article. It is the timestamp of when the mention was recorded in the GDELT system.

3. **DATEADDED**: This field stores the date and time (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the event was added to the master GDELT database, in UTC timezone.

4. **V2.1DATE**: This is the date (in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format) on which the news media document (the article) was published. This date reflects the publication date of the article itself, not the date of the event discussed in the article. It is the same for all rows in a GKG file and is used to identify when the news article was released.

In summary, the **date mentioned in news articles** can refer to either the date/time of the event itself (EventTimeDate), the date/time the mention was recorded (MentionTimeDate), the date the event was added to the database (DATEADDED), or the publication date of the news article (V2.1DATE). The **V2.1DATE** specifically corresponds to the publication date of the news article from which the information was extracted.","Date Mentions refer to the list of date references found in news articles and documents, which are extracted to identify repeating mentions of specific dates as possible “anniversary violence” indicators.

how GKG 2.1 help to know Russia with people and roles in news articles when before it was hard to connect them all together in one place?,"['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array', '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3', 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and events driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context. However, with the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together. For example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all appeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in that article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, but there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional roles. GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article. While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new field allows for simple proximity-based contextualization. In the case of the example article above, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to the others. In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other connectivity can be explored.

Previously, an article might list multiple people (e.g., Vladimir Putin, Barack Obama, John Kerry), locations (e.g., Russia, United States), and roles (e.g., President, Secretary of State) but did not provide a way to link each person to their specific location or role. This lack of association made it hard to connect all relevant information about Russia and its people in one place.

GKG 2.1 solves this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object (person, location, role) within the original article text. This allows for proximity-based contextualization: for example, the mention of ""Russia"" is likely to be closer in the text to ""Vladimir Putin"" than to ""Barack Obama,"" and the role ""President"" is likely closer to ""Vladimir Putin"" than to others. This proximity information enables users to infer which person is associated with which location and role, thus connecting the dots more effectively.

Pilot tests have shown that these proximity indicators are highly effective at recovering functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations, making it much easier to explore critical information about Russia, its people, and their roles as presented in news articles—all consolidated in one place.

In summary, GKG 2.1 enhances the ability to:

- Link individuals like Vladimir Putin to Russia and their specific roles (e.g., President) within the same article.
- Use character offset proximity to associate people, locations, and roles without requiring deep semantic analysis.
- Explore thematic, geographic, and functional connections in news coverage about Russia more comprehensively and accurately than before.","GKG 2.1 helps by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article, which allows for simple proximity-based contextualization. This means that while it does not allow for deeper semantic association, it can show that mentions of Russia likely occur closer to certain people like Vladimir Putin, and roles like President or Secretary of State occur closer to the relevant individuals. This proximity information helps recover functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations involving Russia and people mentioned in the news, which was difficult with the previous GKG system that only recorded co-occurrence without associating each person with locations and roles."

To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html', 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.

We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3', '[23, 28].\nThroughout this work we use the GDELT dataset as a case study.\nGDELT is a massive collection of\nnews reports that provide a real-time computational record of global events that is published every 15\nminutes. It aggregates information from various news sources, blogs, and social media platforms to construct\na large collection of data including information on people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions.\nEssentially, GDELT offers a snapshot of the world’s collective events, enabling researchers and analysts to\nexplore complex patterns and relationships within global society. By analyzing this data, it’s possible to\nidentify emerging trends, assess risks, understand public sentiment, and track the evolution of various issues\nover time. The applications of GDELT are diverse and far-reaching. Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT). But in fact GDELT-GKG2 is implemented as multiple\nlinked tables recording information about the relationship between articles and events, and thus effectively\nhas the structure of a relational database. Another important contribution of this paper is to actually realize\nGKG2 properly in the mathematical form of a KG, effectively a graph database, derived from and consistent\nwith its native relational database form. To facilitate this effort, we have identified a lightweight ontology\nfor GDELT in the form of its graph schema, realizing its relational database schema in a KG form.\nUsing the KG that we construct from the GDELT-GKG2 dataset, we provide a case study to explore the\nutility of LLM-based tools to extract information and confirm that the KG can be used for question-answering\nin cases where traditional RAG fails. As part of our analysis, we compare to KGs produced from processing\nvarious news articles with an LLM, prompting it to try and adhere to a reduced version of the same ontology.\nThe current state of neurosymbolic work is noted for the plethora of experimental architectures available.\nWhile details are explicated below in Section 3.2, we preview ours in Figure 1, including the five method-\nological pathways which are quantitatively compared: 1) graph queries on the KG (called the DKG) derived\n“directly” from GKG2; 2) use of G-Retriever2 [7] against the same DKG; 3) RAG against a vector store\nrepresentation of GKG2; 4) G-Retriever against a second KG (called the LKG) derived from using Llamain-\ndex3 [1] against the GDELT source articles; and 5) GraphRAG4 Q&A deployed against a third KG (called\nGRKG) using Microsoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters.\nFigure 1: Pipeline of different experiments ran to analyze the GDELT database using an LLM.\n2https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever\n3https://www.llamaindex.ai/\n4https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/\n2']","['<1-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', '<2-hop>\n\nadds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening entirely new analytic opportunities. Some of the most significant changes: \uf0b7 Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes. The GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment analysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual dimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, French, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Urdu). GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents and reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from LIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \uf0b7 Realtime Translation of 65 Languages. GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT Translingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine translation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, representing 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into English for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines. GDELT Translingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the very first glimpses of a world without language barriers. The GKG system now processes every news report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \uf0b7 Relevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds. A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now specify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that represents the core focus of the article. GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats. In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \uf0b7 Quotes, Names, and Amounts. The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food prices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable item. GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to offer numeric context to global events. In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative. Finally, GDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the evolving language used by political leadership across the world. \uf0b7']","The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 enables the realtime measurement of emotions and themes across multiple languages primarily through the integration of the GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module and the GDELT Translingual system, as described in the codebook:

1. **Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes:**
   - The GCAM module represents one of the largest deployments of sentiment analysis globally.
   - It combines 24 different emotional measurement packages to assess over 2,300 distinct emotions and themes from every news article in realtime.
   - This analysis is multilingual, natively supporting 15 languages including Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, French, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Urdu.
   - GCAM incorporates a wide array of emotional dimensions from various established lexicons and tools, such as LIWC’s “Anxiety,” Lexicoder’s “Positivity,” WordNet Affect’s “Smugness,” and RID’s “Passivity.”
   - This enables an unparalleled assessment of emotional undercurrents and reactions on a planetary scale.

2. **Realtime Translation of 65 Languages:**
   - GDELT 2.0 introduces GDELT Translingual, a large-scale realtime streaming news machine translation system.
   - It translates news monitored in 65 languages (covering 98.4% of non-English news volume) into English in realtime.
   - This translation allows the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines to process global news without language barriers.
   - As a result, the GKG system can trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems seamlessly.

**New Analytic Opportunities Introduced:**

- The combination of realtime multilingual sentiment analysis and extensive machine translation opens up entirely new analytic possibilities, such as:
  - Monitoring and quantifying emotional and thematic content globally in realtime, across a vast array of languages and cultures.
  - Capturing the emotional undercurrents and societal reactions to events as they unfold worldwide.
  - Enabling cross-lingual tracking of themes, emotions, and entities, which was previously difficult due to language barriers.
  - Supporting large-scale, nuanced social science research, risk assessment, event monitoring, and trend analysis that incorporate emotional and thematic dimensions.
  - Providing a planetary-scale view of how the world is feeling about events, not just what is happening.

In summary, GKG Version 2.1’s integration of GCAM’s extensive multilingual emotional measurement and GDELT Translingual’s realtime translation capabilities allows for comprehensive, realtime, multilingual emotional and thematic analysis of global news, unlocking new dimensions of global societal insight and analytic potential.","The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 enhances the ability to measure emotions and themes in realtime by integrating the GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module, which deploys 24 emotional measurement packages assessing more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article. This system natively analyzes emotions in 15 languages, including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, and Spanish, among others. Additionally, GDELT 2.0 introduces GDELT Translingual, a realtime streaming news machine translation system that translates news from 65 languages into English, covering 98.4% of non-English monitoring volume. This allows the GKG to process news reports globally across languages, tracing people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions seamlessly. These capabilities open entirely new analytic opportunities by enabling unparalleled assessment of emotional undercurrents and reactions at a planetary scale, supporting sophisticated sentiment analysis and cross-lingual event tracking that were not possible before."
"How does the introduction of Unique Record Identifiers in the GKG 2.1 system address the Limitations of previous GKG system in associating contextual details such as people, locations, and functional roles within news articles?","['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.

The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one.

To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier. As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection. The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will make it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. 1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","The introduction of Unique Record Identifiers (GKGRECORDID) in the GKG 2.1 system addresses the limitations of the previous GKG system in associating contextual details within news articles by enabling precise, document-level identification and improved contextual association through character offset referencing.

**Key points on how Unique Record Identifiers address previous limitations:**

1. **Unique Identification of Each Article Record:**  
   Each GKG record in version 2.1 is assigned a globally unique identifier (GKGRECORDID) that uniquely identifies a single document or article record across the entire GKG database. This contrasts with the previous system where multiple articles with the same metadata were clustered together, making it difficult to distinguish and associate specific contextual details within individual articles.

2. **No Clustering of Articles with Shared Metadata:**  
   Unlike GKG 1.0, which clustered articles sharing the same sets of locations, people, organizations, and themes into a single record, GKG 2.1 treats each article as a separate record with its own unique identifier. This allows for more granular analysis and association of contextual details at the individual article level, rather than at an aggregated level.

3. **Approximate Character Offsets for References:**  
   GKG 2.1 provides the approximate character offset of each reference to an object (people, locations, functional roles) within the original article text. While this does not enable deep semantic linking, it allows for proximity-based contextualization. For example, it becomes possible to infer that mentions of ""United States"" occur closer to ""Barack Obama"" and ""John Kerry"" than to ""Vladimir Putin,"" and that the role ""Secretary of State"" is mentioned nearer to ""John Kerry."" This proximity information helps associate people with their corresponding locations and functional roles within the same article.

4. **Enhanced Contextual Connectivity:**  
   By combining unique record identifiers with character offset data, GKG 2.1 enables exploration of critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other connectivity within articles. This was not feasible in the previous system where only co-occurrence of entities in an article was recorded without any way to link them contextually.

In summary, the Unique Record Identifiers in GKG 2.1, together with character offset referencing, overcome the previous system’s inability to associate people, locations, and functional roles within articles by uniquely identifying each article and enabling proximity-based contextual associations of entities within that article.","The previous GKG system had limitations in associating various data points together, such as linking people like Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin with their corresponding locations and functional roles within the same article. Although GKG 2.1 improved this by providing approximate character offsets to enable proximity-based contextualization, it still lacked deeper semantic association. To further enhance data management and referencing, GKG 2.1 introduced Unique Record Identifiers, which assign a unique identifier to every GKG record. These identifiers do not indicate sequence but uniquely identify each record across the entire collection, making it easier to refer to and manage specific records. This addition complements the proximity-based improvements by enabling precise and unambiguous referencing of individual records, thereby addressing some of the previous system's limitations in handling complex contextual details."

Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.

Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode highly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \uf0b7', '<2-hop>\n\nUnique Record Identifiers. To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier. As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection. The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will make it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. 1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","The introduction of unique record identifiers in GKG 2.1 addresses the limitations of the previous GKG system by enabling precise, document-level identification and association of contextual details within news articles. Previously, the GKG system could extract entities such as people, locations, and functional roles from an article but lacked the ability to associate these elements with each other within the same article. For example, while Barack Obama, John Kerry, Vladimir Putin, the United States, Russia, and roles like President and Secretary of State might all be mentioned in an article, the earlier system could not link each person to their corresponding location or role.

GKG 2.1 overcomes this limitation by assigning a globally unique identifier (GKGRECORDID) to each record, which corresponds to a single document or article. This unique ID allows users to refer unambiguously to a specific article and its extracted metadata. More importantly, GKG 2.1 provides the approximate character offset of each reference to an object within the original article text. Although this does not enable deep semantic linking, it allows for proximity-based contextualization—entities mentioned close together in the text are likely related. For instance, mentions of the United States are likely closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, and the role ""Secretary of State"" is likely closer to John Kerry than to others. This proximity information enables users to infer functional, thematic, and geographic associations between people, locations, and roles within the same article.

In summary, unique record identifiers in GKG 2.1 facilitate:

- Unambiguous referencing of individual articles and their metadata.
- The use of character offsets to associate entities and roles based on their proximity in the text.
- Improved exploration of relationships among people, locations, and functional roles within news articles, which was not possible in the previous GKG system.","The previous GKG system struggled to associate various data points such as people, organizations, locations, and functional roles within news articles, making it difficult to link each person with the corresponding location and role. GKG 2.1 addresses these limitations by providing the approximate character offset of each reference in the original article, enabling proximity-based contextualization that helps recover functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations. Additionally, GKG 2.1 introduces unique record identifiers for every GKG record, which uniquely identify each record across the entire collection. This addition facilitates easier and unambiguous referencing of particular GKG records, thereby improving the management and association of contextual details that were previously difficult to connect."
How does the GKG 2.1 format improve GDELT Event Database integration and align with the Events dataset format compared to previous versions?,"['THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).', 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', '2\nConstructing a Knowledge Graph for GDELT\nAs previously mentioned, while the GDELT-GKG2 dataset is not actually natively in the form of a knowledge\ngraph, it is advertised and frequently cited as being one. We believe that we are making a distinct contribution\nto the research community by converting the very popular GKG2 database into a proper KG.\nGKG2 is natively a database of three related tables:\n• expert.csv captures event information;\n• GKG.csv captures article information; and\n• mentions.csv relates which articles mention which events.\nFigure 2: GDELT GKG 2.0 schema relating articles (GKG), mentions, and events (Export).\nThe database schema for these three CSV files is shown in Fig. 2 (see also [9]). The key characteristics of\nthis database relational schema should be interpreted as follows:\n• The three tables are color-coded by Events (green), Mentions (pink), and Articles (blue).\n• The single table of Events is shown in multiple green sub-tables, simply for clarity and convenience to\nlayout a long record structure.\n• Single-headed arrows represent one-to-many relationships between the tables. Specifically:\n– Each Event maps to multiple Mentions via the shared GLOBALEVENTID field.\n– Each Article maps to multiple Mentions via the DocumentIdentifer field on the Article side\nmatching to the MentionIdentifier field on the Mention side.\n• In this way, the Mentions table acts as a “pairs file” recording a many-many relation between Events\nand Articles: each event can be mentioned in multiple articles, and dually each article can men-\ntion many events. Each Article also has both a unique identifier through the GKGRECORDID or the\nDocumentIdentifer fields, since each row in the GKG data represents a single article.\n3', 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.

1. **Closer Alignment with Events Dataset Format**:  
   - GKG 2.1 introduces several new fields that enable structural mapping and closer alignment with the format used for the GDELT Events dataset. This facilitates easier integration and cross-referencing between the GKG and Events data.

2. **Single Unified Data File**:  
   - Unlike earlier versions where there were two separate GKG files (one for counts only and one full file), GKG 2.1 consolidates these into a single data file. This simplification reflects that most users require the full thematic and contextual data to relate counts to events, improving usability and integration.

3. **Unique Record Identifiers**:  
   - GKG 2.1 assigns a unique identifier to every GKG record, similar to the unique identifiers used in the GDELT Event Database. This standardization makes it easier to uniquely reference and link GKG records with events and mentions, enhancing relational data integrity and integration.

4. **No Clustering of Articles Based on Shared Metadata**:  
   - Unlike GKG 1.0, which clustered articles with identical metadata into single records, GKG 2.1 treats each article as a separate record even if they share the same locations, themes, people, and organizations. This change aligns better with the event-level granularity of the Events dataset and supports document-level provenance, which is important for linking articles to specific events.

5. **Expanded Inclusion Criteria**:  
   - GKG 2.1 relaxes the minimum criteria for article inclusion. Previously, articles had to contain at least one geocoded location to be included. Now, articles are included if they contain any successfully extracted information, including emotional scores (GCAM), even if no geographic location is mentioned. This broader inclusion aligns with the Events dataset’s comprehensive coverage and allows for richer contextual integration.

6. **Approximate Character Offsets for Mentions**:  
   - GKG 2.1 provides approximate character offsets for each reference to an object (person, location, organization, etc.) within the original article text. This feature allows for proximity-based contextualization of entities and roles, improving the ability to associate people with locations and functional roles. This enhancement supports more nuanced integration with event data, which often requires understanding the relationships between actors and locations.

7. **Extensible XML Block (V2EXTRASXML)**:  
   - GKG 2.1 includes an extensible XML field to encode specialized data types that may not be present in standard news coverage but are relevant for certain subsets of data (e.g., academic citations). This extensibility supports future integration needs and aligns with the evolving complexity of the Events dataset.

In summary, GKG 2.1 improves GDELT Event Database integration and alignment by standardizing identifiers, unifying data files, enhancing granularity and provenance at the article level, expanding inclusion criteria, adding contextual proximity data, and enabling extensibility—all of which facilitate more seamless and detailed linking between the GKG and Events datasets.","The GKG 2.1 format improves GDELT Event Database integration by eliminating the separate counts-only file and providing a single full GKG data file that includes thematic and other data fields to contextualize counts and tie them into the Event Database. Additionally, GKG 2.1 aligns more closely with the Events dataset format by introducing new fields that enable structural mapping to a forthcoming hierarchical representation. Unlike earlier versions, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents based on shared metadata, allowing each article to appear separately with its own GCAM emotional scores, which supports more precise provenance identification and richer metadata. Furthermore, the minimum inclusion criteria were relaxed so that articles without geocoded locations but containing any extracted information, including GCAM scores, are now included, broadening the scope of relevant content for GDELT users."

Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.

A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).', 'records GDELT’s confidence in its extraction of that event from that particular article.  This field is a \npercent, ranging from 10 to 100% and indicates how aggressively GDELT had to perform tasks like \ncoreference or grammatical restructuring to extract the event from that article.  Sorting all mentions of \nan event by this field makes it possible to identify articles featuring the strongest and most \nunambiguous discussion of an event. \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer)  This is the ID of the event that was mentioned in the article. \n\uf0b7 \nEventTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the \nevent being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT (the DATEADDED field of the original event \nrecord).  This field can be compared against the next one to identify events being mentioned for \nthe first time (their first mentions) or to identify events of a particular vintage being mentioned \nnow (such as filtering for mentions of events at least one week old). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) of the \ncurrent update.  This is identical for all entries in the update file but is included to make it easier \nto load the Mentions table into a database.   \n\uf0b7 \nMentionType.  (integer)  This is a numeric identifier that refers to the source collection the \ndocument came from and is used to interpret the MentionIdentifier in the next column.  In \nessence, it specifies how to interpret the MentionIdentifier to locate the actual document.  At \npresent, it can hold one of the following values: \no 1 = WEB (The document originates from the open web and the MentionIdentifier is a \nfully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web). \no 2 = CITATIONONLY (The document originates from a broadcast, print, or other offline \nsource in which only a textual citation is available for the document.  In this case the \nMentionIdentifier contains the textual citation for the document). \no 3 = CORE (The document originates from the CORE archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the CORE \nwebsite). \no 4 = DTIC (The document originates from the DTIC archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the DTIC website). \no 5 = JSTOR (The document originates from the JSTOR archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through your JSTOR \nsubscription if your institution subscribes to it). \no 6 = NONTEXTUALSOURCE (The document originates from a textual proxy (such as closed \ncaptioning) of a non-textual information source (such as a video) available via a URL and \nthe MentionIdentifier provides the URL of the non-textual original source.  At present, \nthis Collection Identifier is used for processing of the closed captioning streams of the \nInternet Archive Television News Archive in which each broadcast is available via a URL, \nbut the URL offers access only to the video of the broadcast and does not provide any \naccess to the textual closed captioning used to generate the metadata.  This code is \nused in order to draw a distinction between URL-based textual material (Collection \nIdentifier 1 (WEB) and URL-based non-textual material like the Television News Archive). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionSourceName.  (integer)  This is a human-friendly identifier of the source of the \ndocument.  For material originating from the open web with a URL this field will contain the top-\nlevel domain the page was from.  For BBC Monitoring material it will contain “BBC Monitoring” \nand for JSTOR material it will contain “JSTOR.”  This field is intended for human display of major \nsources as well as for network analysis of information flows by source, obviating the \nrequirement to perform domain or other parsing of the MentionIdentifier field.', 'References\n[1] Knowledge\ngraph\nindex.\nhttps://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/index_structs/\nknowledge_graph/KnowledgeGraphDemo/.

Thus, we are eliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \uf0b7 Production Status. The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into production status. This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change.']","The GDELT Event database uses the **Mentions table** and the **Confidence measure** to filter and identify the best news reports for events as follows:

1. **Mentions Table**:
   - The Mentions table records every individual mention of an event found in news articles. For example, if an event is mentioned in 100 different articles, there will be 100 entries in the Mentions table for that event.
   - Each mention includes detailed metadata such as the source URL, the position of the mention within the article (e.g., sentence number, character offset), the source type (web, broadcast, archive, etc.), and the length and tone of the article.
   - This table allows tracking the trajectory and network of a story as it spreads through global media, including mentions of historical or anniversary events.

2. **Confidence Measure**:
   - The Confidence field in the Mentions table is a percentage (ranging from 10% to 100%) that indicates how confidently GDELT's natural language processing algorithms extracted the event from that specific article.
   - A higher Confidence score means the event extraction was more straightforward and less reliant on complex linguistic inference (like coreference resolution or grammatical restructuring), implying a clearer, more unambiguous mention.
   - Mentions with a Confidence of 100% are likely to be the most detailed and unambiguous descriptions of the event.
   - The Confidence measure helps filter out ambiguous or less reliable mentions, allowing users to focus on the strongest, clearest reports.

3. **Filtering for Best News Reports**:
   - By sorting or filtering mentions of an event based on the Confidence score, users can identify the articles that provide the most reliable and detailed coverage of that event.
   - Additional filters can be applied using the mention's position in the article (e.g., mentions in the lead paragraph are more prominent), the source language, or the source type.
   - This enables dynamic filtering tailored to specific use cases, such as:
     - Finding the earliest or most detailed breaking news reports.
     - Selecting only the largest or most significant events with strong, clear descriptions.
     - Choosing the best news report for a given event by selecting mentions with the highest Confidence, best positioning, and preferred source language.

In summary, the GDELT Event database leverages the Mentions table to capture all instances of event reporting and uses the Confidence measure to assess the quality and clarity of each mention. Filtering events by these measures allows users to extract the best, most reliable news reports for any given event.","The GDELT Event database includes a new Mentions table in GDELT 2.0 that records all mentions of each event across multiple news reports. Each mention includes key indicators such as the location within the article where the mention appeared and a Confidence measure. The Confidence measure allows users to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases, enabling filtering of the Event stream to find only the largest events with strongly detailed descriptions or to capture early or small-bore events. By filtering mentions for those with the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or specific source languages, users can identify the ""best"" news report to return for a given event."
"How does the introduction of the GCAM system in the GKG 2.1 format enhance the granularity and scope of emotional and thematic analysis compared to the clustering approach used in GKG 1.0, and what new analytic opportunities does GCAM enable through its multilingual and realtime capabilities?","['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html', '[23, 28].\nThroughout this work we use the GDELT dataset as a case study.\nGDELT is a massive collection of\nnews reports that provide a real-time computational record of global events that is published every 15\nminutes. It aggregates information from various news sources, blogs, and social media platforms to construct\na large collection of data including information on people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions.\nEssentially, GDELT offers a snapshot of the world’s collective events, enabling researchers and analysts to\nexplore complex patterns and relationships within global society. By analyzing this data, it’s possible to\nidentify emerging trends, assess risks, understand public sentiment, and track the evolution of various issues\nover time. The applications of GDELT are diverse and far-reaching. Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT). But in fact GDELT-GKG2 is implemented as multiple\nlinked tables recording information about the relationship between articles and events, and thus effectively\nhas the structure of a relational database. Another important contribution of this paper is to actually realize\nGKG2 properly in the mathematical form of a KG, effectively a graph database, derived from and consistent\nwith its native relational database form. To facilitate this effort, we have identified a lightweight ontology\nfor GDELT in the form of its graph schema, realizing its relational database schema in a KG form.\nUsing the KG that we construct from the GDELT-GKG2 dataset, we provide a case study to explore the\nutility of LLM-based tools to extract information and confirm that the KG can be used for question-answering\nin cases where traditional RAG fails. As part of our analysis, we compare to KGs produced from processing\nvarious news articles with an LLM, prompting it to try and adhere to a reduced version of the same ontology.\nThe current state of neurosymbolic work is noted for the plethora of experimental architectures available.\nWhile details are explicated below in Section 3.2, we preview ours in Figure 1, including the five method-\nological pathways which are quantitatively compared: 1) graph queries on the KG (called the DKG) derived\n“directly” from GKG2; 2) use of G-Retriever2 [7] against the same DKG; 3) RAG against a vector store\nrepresentation of GKG2; 4) G-Retriever against a second KG (called the LKG) derived from using Llamain-\ndex3 [1] against the GDELT source articles; and 5) GraphRAG4 Q&A deployed against a third KG (called\nGRKG) using Microsoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters.\nFigure 1: Pipeline of different experiments ran to analyze the GDELT database using an LLM.\n2https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever\n3https://www.llamaindex.ai/\n4https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/\n2']","['<1-hop>\n\nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 The GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were released in that format. With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has remained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of significant enhancements to the GKG system. While it was originally intended to release these new features in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these fields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and the need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical representation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to accommodate these goals. Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to the GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification. Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of special subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 compatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be supported for news content. From a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 revolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the GKG stream. Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event stream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG metadata. Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would be grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2. With the introduction of the new GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear that the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, themes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very different GCAM scores. In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture necessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level. Thus, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of extracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the GKG stream. The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering. In addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article to appear in the GKG. Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output. However, many topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy discussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a single location. This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of high relevance to many GDELT user communities. Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in the GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional scores. An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', '<2-hop>\n\nadds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening entirely new analytic opportunities. Some of the most significant changes: \uf0b7 Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes. The GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment analysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual dimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, French, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Urdu). GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents and reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from LIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \uf0b7 Realtime Translation of 65 Languages. GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT Translingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine translation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, representing 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into English for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines. GDELT Translingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the very first glimpses of a world without language barriers. The GKG system now processes every news report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \uf0b7 Relevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds. A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now specify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that represents the core focus of the article. GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats. In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \uf0b7 Quotes, Names, and Amounts. The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food prices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable item. GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to offer numeric context to global events. In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative. Finally, GDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the evolving language used by political leadership across the world. \uf0b7']","The introduction of the GCAM (Global Content Analysis Measures) system in the GKG 2.1 format significantly enhances the granularity and scope of emotional and thematic analysis compared to the clustering approach used in GKG 1.0, and it enables new analytic opportunities through its multilingual and realtime capabilities in the following ways:

### Enhanced Granularity and Scope Compared to GKG 1.0 Clustering

1. **From Clustering to Individual Article-Level Analysis:**
   - **GKG 1.0 Approach:** Articles were clustered together if they shared the same metadata (locations, themes, people, organizations), resulting in a single aggregated record with a count of articles (NumArticles). This clustering meant that differences in language use, emotional tone, or thematic nuance across articles with the same metadata were lost.
   - **GKG 2.1 with GCAM:** The system no longer clusters articles based on shared metadata. Instead, each article is represented as a separate entry in the GKG stream. This is crucial because multiple articles mentioning the same entities can express very different emotions and themes, which GCAM captures individually. This shift allows for much finer-grained emotional and thematic analysis at the document level.

2. **Massive Expansion of Emotional and Thematic Dimensions:**
   - GCAM integrates 24 emotional measurement packages, collectively assessing over 2,300 distinct emotions and themes. This is a vast increase in the depth and breadth of emotional and thematic coding compared to previous versions.
   - The system includes diverse emotional dimensions from multiple lexicons and frameworks, such as LIWC’s “Anxiety,” Lexicoder’s “Positivity,” WordNet Affect’s “Smugness,” and RID’s “Passivity,” enabling a rich, multidimensional emotional profile of each article.

3. **Inclusion of Articles Without Geographic Mentions:**
   - Unlike GKG 1.0, which required at least one geocoded location for inclusion, GKG 2.1 includes articles based on any successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores. This broadens the scope of content covered, allowing analysis of topics that are less geographically centered (e.g., cybersecurity, constitutional discourse).

### New Analytic Opportunities Enabled by Multilingual and Realtime Capabilities

1. **Realtime Measurement Across Multiple Languages:**
   - GCAM natively assesses emotions and themes in 15 languages (including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, and others), enabling direct multilingual emotional analysis without relying solely on translation.
   - This multilingual capability allows for capturing cultural and linguistic nuances in emotional expression that might be lost or distorted in translation.

2. **Realtime Translation of 65 Languages:**
   - GDELT 2.0’s Translingual system translates news from 65 languages into English in realtime, covering 98.4% of non-English news volume monitored.
   - This enables the GKG system to process and analyze global news content at full volume, breaking down language barriers and allowing tracing of people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems.
   - The realtime aspect means that emotional and thematic trends can be monitored as they unfold globally, supporting timely insights and responses.

3. **Provenance and Document-Level Metadata:**
   - Because clustering is removed, and each article is individually represented, GCAM can associate emotional and thematic scores with specific documents, preserving provenance and enabling detailed tracking of how different sources and regions express emotions and themes.

4. **Integration with Other Rich Metadata:**
   - GCAM’s emotional and thematic data can be combined with other new GKG 2.1 features such as proximity context (character offsets linking entities and roles), quotes, numeric amounts, and multimedia content, enabling complex, multidimensional analyses of news narratives and their emotional undercurrents.

### Summary

- **GKG 1.0:** Clustered articles by shared metadata, losing individual emotional and thematic variation; required geographic mentions for inclusion; limited emotional/thematic scope.
- **GKG 2.1 with GCAM:** Provides article-level, realtime, multilingual emotional and thematic analysis across 2,300+ dimensions; includes articles without geographic mentions; enables tracking of nuanced emotional undercurrents globally and in near real-time; supports new analytic approaches leveraging rich, multidimensional metadata and breaking language barriers.

These enhancements allow researchers and analysts to perform far more detailed, timely, and globally comprehensive emotional and thematic analyses of news content than was previously possible.","The introduction of the GCAM system in the GKG 2.1 format fundamentally changes how articles are represented by no longer clustering documents based on shared metadata, as was done in GKG 1.0. Under GKG 1.0, articles with identical locations, themes, people, and organizations were grouped together, which was insufficient for GCAM because multiple articles with the same metadata could express very different emotions and themes, resulting in distinct GCAM scores. GCAM assesses more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article in realtime, across 15 languages natively, enabling a highly granular and nuanced emotional and thematic analysis at a planetary scale. This shift allows GKG 2.1 to include articles even without geographic mentions, broadening the scope of content captured. Furthermore, GCAM’s realtime multilingual sentiment analysis, combined with GDELT’s realtime translation of 65 languages, opens entirely new analytic opportunities by enabling the tracing of emotional undercurrents and reactions globally without language barriers. This includes the ability to analyze a vast array of emotional dimensions from multiple established measurement packages, providing unparalleled insight into global news content and its emotional context."
How do the Actor1Geo and Location fields utilize FIPS10-4 codes to specify geographic locations at different administrative levels in the dataset?,"['\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_Type.  (integer) This field specifies the geographic resolution of the match type and \nholds one of the following values:  1=COUNTRY (match was at the country level), 2=USSTATE \n(match was to a US state), 3=USCITY (match was to a US city or landmark), 4=WORLDCITY \n(match was to a city or landmark outside the US), 5=WORLDSTATE (match was to an \nAdministrative Division 1 outside the US – roughly equivalent to a US state).  This can be used to \nfilter events by geographic specificity, for example, extracting only those events with a \nlandmark-level geographic resolution for mapping.  Note that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), \n2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still provide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the \ncentroid of that country or state, but the FeatureID field below will be blank. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_Fullname.  (string) This is the full human-readable name of the matched location.  In \nthe case of a country it is simply the country name.  For US and World states it is in the format of \n“State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the format of “City/Landmark, State, \nCountry”.  This can be used to label locations when placing events on a map.  NOTE: this field \nreflects the precise name used to refer to the location in the text itself, meaning it may contain \nmultiple spellings of the same location – use the FeatureID column to determine whether two \nlocation names refer to the same place. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_CountryCode.  (string) This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code for the location. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_ADM1Code.  (string). This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code followed by the \n2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code for the administrative division \nhousing the landmark.  In the case of the United States, this is the 2-character shortform of the \nstate’s name (such as “TX” for Texas). \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_ADM2Code.  (string).  For international locations this is the numeric Global \nAdministrative Unit Layers (GAUL) administrative division 2 (ADM2) code assigned to each global \nlocation, while for US locations this is the two-character shortform of the state’s name (such as \n“TX” for Texas) followed by the 3-digit numeric county code (following the INCITS 31:200x \nstandard used in GNIS).  For more detail on the contents and computation of this field, please \nsee the following footnoted URL. 5  NOTE:  This field may be blank/null in cases where no ADM2 \ninformation was available, for some ADM1-level matches, and for all country-level matches.  \nNOTE: this field may still contain a value for ADM1-level matches depending on how they are \ncodified in GNS. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_Lat.  (floating point) This is the centroid latitude of the landmark for mapping. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_Long.

More \ninformation on these values can be found in Leetaru (2012).6  NOTE: When Actor1Geo_Type has \na value of 3 or 4 this field will contain a signed numeric value, while it will contain a textual \nFeatureID in the case of other match resolutions (usually the country code or country code and \nADM1 code).  A small percentage of small cities and towns may have a blank value in this field \neven for Actor1Geo_Type values of 3 or 4: this will be corrected in the 2.0 release of GDELT.  \nNOTE: This field can contain both positive and negative numbers, see Leetaru (2012) for more \ninformation on this. \n \nThese codes are repeated for Actor2 and Action, using those prefixes. \n \nDATA MANAGEMENT FIELDS \n \n                                                          \n5 http://blog.gdeltproject.org/global-second-order-administrative-divisions-now-available-from-gaul/ \n6 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html', 'proximity to it.

(semicolon-delimited blocks, with pound symbol (“#”) delimited fields)  This is a \nlist of all locations found in the text, extracted through the Leetaru (2012) algorithm. 2  The \nalgorithm is run in a more aggressive stance here than ordinary in order to extract every \npossible locative referent, so may have a slightly elevated level of false positives.  NOTE: some \nlocations have multiple accepted formal or informal names and this field is collapsed on name, \nrather than feature (since in some applications the understanding of a geographic feature differs \nbased on which name was used to reference it).  In cases where it is necessary to collapse by \nfeature, the Geo_FeatureID column should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column.  This \nis because the Geo_Fullname column captures the name of the location as expressed in the text \nand thus reflects differences in transliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for \nthe same location.  For example, Mecca is often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly \nspelled Jiddah or Jaddah.  The Geo_Fullname column will reflect each of these different \nspellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the same unique GNS or GNIS \nfeature identification number.  For more information on the GNS and GNIS identifiers, see \nLeetaru (2012). 3  This field is identical in format and population as the corresponding field in the \nGKG 1.0  format.  NOTE: there was an error in this field from 2/19/2015 through midday \n3/1/2015 that caused the CountryCode field to list the wrong country code in some cases. \no Location Type.  (integer) This field specifies the geographic resolution of the match type \nand holds one of the following values:  1=COUNTRY (match was at the country level), \n2=USSTATE (match was to a US state), 3=USCITY (match was to a US city or landmark), \n4=WORLDCITY (match was to a city or landmark outside the US), 5=WORLDSTATE \n(match was to an Administrative Division 1 outside the US – roughly equivalent to a US \nstate).  This can be used to filter counts by geographic specificity, for example, \nextracting only those counts with a landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping.  \nNote that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), 2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still \nprovide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the centroid of that country or state, but \nthe FeatureID field below will contain its textual country or ADM1 code instead of a \nnumeric featureid. \no Location FullName.  (text) This is the full human-readable name of the matched \nlocation.  In the case of a country it is simply the country name.  For US and World states \nit is in the format of “State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the \nformat of “City/Landmark, State, Country”.  This can be used to label locations when \nplacing counts on a map.  Note: this field reflects the precise name used to refer to the \nlocation in the text itself, meaning it may contain multiple spellings of the same location \n– use the FeatureID column to determine whether two location names refer to the same \nplace. \no Location CountryCode.  (text) This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code for the \nlocation.  Note: GDELT continues to use the FIPS10-4 codes under USG guidance while \nGNS continues its formal transition to the successor Geopolitical Entities, Names, and \nCodes (GENC) Standard (the US Government profile of ISO 3166). \no Location ADM1Code.  (text) This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code followed by \nthe 2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code for the administrative \ndivision housing the landmark.

(text OR signed integer) This is the numeric GNS or GNIS FeatureID \nfor this location OR a textual country or ADM1 code.  More information on these values \ncan be found in Leetaru (2012).4  Note: This field will be blank or contain a textual ADM1 \ncode for country or ADM1-level matches – see above.  Note: For numeric GNS or GNIS \nFeatureIDs, this field can contain both positive and negative numbers, see Leetaru \n(2012) for more information on this. \n\uf0b7 \nV2ENHANCEDLOCATIONS.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with pound symbol (“#”) delimited \nfields)  This field is identical to the V1LOCATIONS field with the primary exception of an extra \nfield appended to the end of each location block after its FeatureID that lists the approximate \ncharacter offset of the reference to that location in the text.  In addition, if a location appears \nmultiple times in the article, it will be listed multiple times in this field.  The only other \nmodification from V1LOCATIONS is the addition of a single new field “Location ADM2Code” in \nbetween “Location ADM1Code” and “Location Latitude”. 5  NOTE: there was an error in this field \nfrom 2/19/2015 through midday 3/1/2015 that caused the CountryCode field to list the wrong \ncountry code in some cases. \n\uf0b7 \nV1PERSONS.  (semicolon-delimited)  This is the list of all person names found in the text, \nextracted through the Leetaru (2012) algorithm. 6  This name recognition algorithm is unique in \nthat it is specially designed to recognize the African, Asian, and Middle Eastern names that yield \nsignificantly reduced accuracy with most name recognition engines.  This field is identical in \nformat and population as the corresponding field in the GKG 1.0  format. \n\uf0b7 \nV2ENHANCEDPERSONS.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This \ncontains a list of all person names referenced in the document, along with the character offsets \nof approximately where in the document they were found.  Each person reference is separated \nby a semicolon, and within each reference, the person name is specified first, followed by a \ncomma, and then the approximate character offset of the reference of that person in the \ndocument, allowing it to be associated with other entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that \nappear in closest proximity to it.  If a person is mentioned multiple times in a document, each \nmention will appear separately in this field. \n\uf0b7 \nV1ORGANIZATIONS.  (semicolon-delimited)  This is the list of all company and organization \nnames found in the text, extracted through the Leetaru (2012) algorithm. 7  This is a \ncombination of corporations, IGOs, NGOs, and any other local organizations such as a local fair \n                                                          \n4 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n5 http://blog.gdeltproject.org/global-second-order-administrative-divisions-now-available-from-gaul/ \n6 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n7 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html', 'occurrence described in the context of a more positive narrative (such as a report of an attack \noccurring in a discussion of improving conditions on the ground in a country and how the \nnumber of attacks per day has been greatly reduced).  NOTE: this field refers only to the first \nnews report to mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context \nin other news reports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the \npositioning of an event, see the Mentions table.  NOTE: this provides only a basic tonal \nassessment of an article and it is recommended that users interested in emotional measures use \nthe Mentions and Global Knowledge Graph tables to merge the complete set of 2,300 emotions \nand themes from the GKG GCAM system into their analysis of event records. \n \nEVENT GEOGRAPHY \n \nThe final set of fields add a novel enhancement to the CAMEO taxonomy, georeferencing each event \nalong three primary dimensions to the landmark-centroid level.  To do this, the fulltext of the source \ndocument is processed using fulltext geocoding and automatic disambiguation to identify every \ngeographic reference.3  The closest reference to each of the two actors and to the action reference are \nthen encoded in these fields.  The georeferenced location for an actor may not always match the \nActor1_CountryCode or Actor2_CountryCode field, such as in a case where the President of Russia is \nvisiting Washington, DC in the United States, in which case the Actor1_CountryCode would contain the \ncode for Russia, while the georeferencing fields below would contain a match for Washington, DC.  It \nmay not always be possible for the system to locate a match for each actor or location, in which case \none or more of the fields may be blank.  The Action fields capture the location information closest to the \npoint in the event description that contains the actual statement of action and is the best location to use \nfor placing events on a map or in other spatial context.   \n \nTo find all events located in or relating to a specific city or geographic landmark, the Geo_FeatureID \ncolumn should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column.  This is because the Geo_Fullname \ncolumn captures the name of the location as expressed in the text and thus reflects differences in \ntransliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for the same location.  For example, Mecca \nis often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly spelled Jiddah or Jaddah.  The Geo_Fullname column \nwill reflect each of these different spellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the \nsame unique GNS or GNIS feature identification number.  For more information on the GNS and GNIS \nidentifiers, see Leetaru (2012). 4 \n \nWhen looking for events in or relating to a specific country, such as Syria, there are two possible filtering \nmethods.  The first is to use the Actor_CountryCode fields in the Actor section to look for all actors \nhaving the SYR (Syria) code.  However, conflict zones are often accompanied by high degrees of \nuncertainty in media reporting and a news article might mention only “Unidentified gunmen stormed a \nhouse and shot 12 civilians.”  In this case, the Actor_CountryCode fields for Actor1 and Actor2 would \nboth be blank, since the article did not specify the actor country affiliations, while their \nGeo_CountryCode values (and the ActorGeo_CountryCode for the event) would specify Syria.  This can \nresult in dramatic differences when examining active conflict zones.  The second method is to examine \nthe ActorGeo_CountryCode for the location of the event.  This will also capture situations such as the \nUnited States criticizing a statement by Russia regarding a specific Syrian attack. \n \n                                                          \n3 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n4 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html', 'terrorists,” but the TABARI ACTORS dictionary labels that group as “Insurgents,” the latter label will be \nused. Use the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph to enrich actors with additional information from the rest \nof the article.  NOTE: the CountryCode field reflects a combination of information from the TABARI \nACTORS dictionary and text, with the ACTORS dictionary taking precedence, and thus if the text refers to \n“French Assistant Minister Smith was in Moscow,” the CountryCode field will list France in the \nCountryCode field, while the geographic fields discussed at the end of this manual may list Moscow as \nhis/her location.  NOTE: One of the two actor fields may be blank in complex or single-actor situations or \nmay contain only minimal detail for actors such as “Unidentified gunmen.” \n \nGDELT currently uses the CAMEO version 1.1b3 taxonomy.

This can be used to filter events by geographic specificity, for example, extracting only those events with a landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping.

Here is how they do so:

1. **Geographic Resolution (Type) Field:**
   - Both **Actor1Geo_Type** and **Location Type** fields specify the geographic resolution of the location match using integer codes:
     - 1 = COUNTRY (country-level)
     - 2 = USSTATE (US state-level)
     - 3 = USCITY (US city or landmark)
     - 4 = WORLDCITY (city or landmark outside the US)
     - 5 = WORLDSTATE (Administrative Division 1 outside the US, roughly equivalent to a US state)
   - This allows filtering and understanding the granularity of the geographic location.

2. **Country Code (FIPS10-4):**
   - The **Actor1Geo_CountryCode** and **Location CountryCode** fields contain the **2-character FIPS10-4 country code** for the location.
   - This code identifies the country uniquely according to the FIPS10-4 standard, which is a US Government standard for geopolitical entities.

3. **Administrative Division 1 Code (ADM1Code):**
   - The **Actor1Geo_ADM1Code** and **Location ADM1Code** fields combine the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code with a 2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 code.
   - For the United States, the ADM1 code is the 2-character short form of the state’s name (e.g., ""TX"" for Texas).
   - For other countries, it corresponds to the first-level administrative division (e.g., provinces, states) as defined by FIPS10-4.
   - This allows specifying locations at the state or equivalent administrative division level.

4. **Administrative Division 2 Code (ADM2Code):**
   - The **Actor1Geo_ADM2Code** and **Location ADM2Code** fields provide further granularity:
     - For international locations, this is a numeric code from the Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) dataset for the second-level administrative division.
     - For US locations, it combines the 2-character state shortform with a 3-digit numeric county code (per INCITS 31:200x standard used in GNIS).
   - This field may be blank if ADM2 information is unavailable or if the location is at a higher administrative level (country or ADM1).

5. **Full Human-Readable Name:**
   - The **Actor1Geo_Fullname** and **Location FullName** fields provide the full name of the location in a human-readable format, reflecting the hierarchy:
     - Country only for country-level matches.
     - ""State, Country"" for US and World states.
     - ""City/Landmark, State, Country"" for city or landmark-level matches.
   - This helps in labeling and understanding the geographic context.

6. **Latitude and Longitude:**
   - Both sets of fields include centroid latitude and longitude for the matched location, which correspond to the geographic center of the country, state, or city.

7. **FeatureID:**
   - The **Actor1Geo_FeatureID** and **Location FeatureID** fields contain either:
     - A textual country or ADM1 code for country or ADM1-level matches.
     - A numeric GNS or GNIS FeatureID for city or landmark-level matches.
   - This provides a unique identifier for the geographic feature, resolving ambiguities in names or spellings.

**Summary:**

- The dataset uses **FIPS10-4 country codes** to identify countries.
- It extends these codes with **FIPS10-4 ADM1 codes** to specify first-level administrative divisions (states or equivalents).
- For finer granularity, it uses **ADM2 codes** (GAUL numeric codes internationally, or state+county codes in the US).
- These codes are combined with human-readable names, geographic coordinates, and unique feature IDs to specify locations at multiple administrative levels.
- This hierarchical coding system allows precise geographic referencing of actors and events from country level down to city or landmark level within the dataset.","Both the Actor1Geo and Location fields use the 2-character FIPS10-4 country codes to specify geographic locations. Actor1Geo_CountryCode and Location CountryCode represent the country using these codes. For more detailed geographic resolution, Actor1Geo_ADM1Code and Location ADM1Code combine the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code with a 2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code to identify subdivisions such as US states or equivalent administrative divisions outside the US. This allows the dataset to specify locations at country and ADM1 levels consistently using FIPS10-4 codes."
"What are the key enhancements introduced in the GKG 2.1 format released in February 2015, and how does the availability of GDELT 2.0 event records starting February 19, 2015, relate to these changes?","['THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array', 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","['<1-hop>\n\nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 The GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were released in that format. With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has remained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of significant enhancements to the GKG system. While it was originally intended to release these new features in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these fields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and the need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical representation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to accommodate these goals. Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to the GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification. Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of special subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 compatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be supported for news content. From a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 revolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the GKG stream. Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event stream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG metadata. Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would be grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2. With the introduction of the new GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear that the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, themes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very different GCAM scores. In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture necessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level. Thus, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of extracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the GKG stream. The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering. In addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article to appear in the GKG. Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output. However, many topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy discussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a single location. This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of high relevance to many GDELT user communities. Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in the GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional scores. An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', '<2-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their descriptions. GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, capturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2. A wide array of variables break out the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, the Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique array of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both actors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the story of each event “in flight” through the global media system. At present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, however in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 format. The Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note that files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited). With the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at least through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without modification. Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning February 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches back to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. There are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset. The first is the traditional Event table. This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several changes as noted below. In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records all mentions of each event. As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those mentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, including the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus being buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event from that specific news report. The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it possible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases. Those wishing to find the earliest glimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of period “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest events with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the highest Confidence measures. This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each individual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below). It also makes it possible to identify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those with the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific source language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).']","The key enhancements introduced in the GKG 2.1 format released in February 2015 include:

1. **Single Data File**: The previous separation of GKG data into two files—one containing counts only and one containing the full GKG data—was eliminated. Now, only a single comprehensive GKG file is provided, simplifying the data environment since most users require the full data for thematic and contextual analysis.

2. **Production Status**: The GKG system moved from Alpha Experimental Release status to production status, meaning the file format is now stabilized and will not change.

3. **No Clustering of Articles**: Unlike GKG 1.0, which clustered articles with identical metadata into single rows, GKG 2.1 treats each article as a separate entry. This change was necessary due to the introduction of the GCAM system, which assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, making clustering based on shared metadata impractical.

4. **Relaxed Inclusion Criteria**: Previously, articles had to contain at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included. GKG 2.1 includes articles even if they have no geographic mentions, as long as they contain any extracted information, such as GCAM emotional scores. This broadens the scope to include topics like cybersecurity and constitutional discourse that may lack geographic references.

5. **New Fields and Capabilities**: GKG 2.1 added several new fields to support significant enhancements, including:
   - Realtime measurement of over 2,300 emotions and themes via the GCAM module.
   - Realtime translation of 65 languages into English (GDELT Translingual).
   - Identification of relevant imagery, videos, and social media embeds.
   - Extraction of quotes, names (including named events, legislation, and dates), and numeric amounts.
   - Extraction of date mentions from articles.
   - Introduction of Proximity Context, providing approximate character offsets of references within articles to enable proximity-based contextualization of people, places, roles, and themes.
   - Addition of over 100 new themes covering economic, social, infrastructure, humanitarian, and environmental topics.
   - Inclusion of an extensible XML block (V2EXTRASXML) for specialized data types applicable to subsets of the collection.
   - Assignment of unique record identifiers to each GKG record for easier referencing.

**Relation to GDELT 2.0 Event Records Availability Starting February 19, 2015:**

- The GDELT 2.0 Event records, which began availability on February 19, 2015, coincide with the release of the GKG 2.1 format. Both represent a major upgrade in the GDELT data ecosystem.
- GDELT 2.0 Event records introduced new features such as a Mentions table (recording multiple mentions of each event with confidence scores and article positioning), enhanced georeferencing, and improved actor and action coding.
- The GKG 2.1 format enhancements complement the GDELT 2.0 Event data by providing richer contextual, thematic, emotional, and multimedia metadata about the news articles that underpin the event data.
- Together, these updates enable more sophisticated, nuanced, and comprehensive analysis of global news events and their contexts, with GKG 2.1 providing the expanded metadata and GDELT 2.0 providing the enhanced event records.
- The simultaneous release and alignment of these formats facilitate integrated use, with GKG 2.1 fields designed to more closely align with the event dataset structure and support new hierarchical representations planned for the future.

In summary, the GKG 2.1 format introduced significant structural and content enhancements to better capture the complexity of global news content, while the availability of GDELT 2.0 event records starting February 19, 2015, marks the rollout of a parallel, upgraded event data format. Both are part of a coordinated effort to advance the GDELT Project’s capabilities in real-time global event and knowledge graph monitoring.","The GKG 2.1 format, released in February 2015, introduced several key enhancements over the previous GKG 2.0 format, including the addition of new fields to support significant system improvements such as the GCAM system that assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, and the removal of clustering of documents based on shared metadata. Unlike GKG 1.0 and 2.0, which required at least one geocoded location for article inclusion, GKG 2.1 includes articles with any successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores, thereby broadening content coverage. Concurrently, GDELT 2.0 event records became available starting February 19, 2015, marking a transition to a new file format with expanded features such as a Mentions table and a Confidence measure for event identification. This timing aligns with the GKG 2.1 release, reflecting a broader upgrade in GDELT data formats to enhance real-time event tracking and metadata richness."
