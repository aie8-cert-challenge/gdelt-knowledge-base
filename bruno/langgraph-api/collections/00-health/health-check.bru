  ## Health Check

  Verifies that the LangGraph server is running and responsive.

  ### Endpoint
  **Correct**: `/ok` (not `/health`)

  Verified against langgraph-api 0.5.20

  ### When to Use
  - Before starting any API workflow
  - As part of automated health monitoring
  - To verify server startup completed successfully

  ### Expected Response
  ```json
  {
    "ok": true
  }
  ```

  ### Performance
  - Latency: < 10ms
  - No external API calls
  - No database queries

  ### Server Information
  For detailed version info, use: `GET /info`

  ### Troubleshooting
  - Connection refused → Server not running (`uv run langgraph dev --allow-blocking`)
  - Timeout → Check firewall/network settings
  - 404 Not Found → Ensure using `/ok` endpoint (not `/health`)
