  ## Get Subgraphs

  Retrieves information about nested subgraphs (if any exist).

  ### When to Use
  - Exploring complex multi-graph architectures
  - Understanding nested workflow structures
  - LangGraph Studio uses this for hierarchical visualization

  ### GDELT Graph
  The current GDELT graph is **simple** (no subgraphs):
  - 2 nodes only: retrieve → generate
  - No nested graphs or teams
  - Direct linear execution

  ### External API Calls Triggered
  Same initialization overhead as other introspection endpoints:
  - HuggingFace HEAD requests (5x)
  - Qdrant GET requests (2x)
  - OpenAI POST /embeddings (1x)

  ### Performance
  - Latency: ~2-3 seconds
  - External API calls: 8 total

  ### Expected Response (GDELT)
  ```json
  {
    "subgraphs": []
  }
  ```

  ### Note
  This endpoint would be more useful for:
  - Multi-agent systems (Session 06 patterns)
  - Team-based architectures
  - Supervisor/worker patterns
  - Nested state machines
