Can you explane the main differnces between GKG 1.0 and the newer versions in terms of data format and usage?,"['\uf0b7 \nMentionIdentifier.  (integer)  This is the unique external identifier for the source document.  It \ncan be used to uniquely identify the document and access it if you have the necessary \nsubscriptions or authorizations and/or the document is public access.  This field can contain a \nrange of values, from URLs of open web resources to textual citations of print or broadcast \nmaterial to DOI identifiers for various document repositories.  For example, if MentionType is \nequal to 1, this field will contain a fully-qualified URL suitable for direct access.  If MentionType \nis equal to 2, this field will contain a textual citation akin to what would appear in an academic \njournal article referencing that document (NOTE that the actual citation format will vary (usually \nbetween APA, Chicago, Harvard, or MLA) depending on a number of factors and no assumptions \nshould be made on its precise format at this time due to the way in which this data is currently \nprovided to GDELT – future efforts will focus on normalization of this field to a standard citation \nformat).  If MentionType is 3, the field will contain a numeric or alpha-numeric DOI that can be \ntyped into JSTOR’s search engine to access the document if your institution has a JSTOR \nsubscription. \n\uf0b7 \nSentenceID.  (integer)  The sentence within the article where the event was mentioned (starting \nwith the first sentence as 1, the second sentence as 2, the third sentence as 3, and so on).  This \ncan be used similarly to the CharOffset fields below, but reports the event’s location in the \narticle in terms of sentences instead of characters, which is more amenable to certain measures \nof the “importance” of an event’s positioning within an article. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1CharOffset.  (integer)  The location within the article (in terms of English characters) \nwhere Actor1 was found.  This can be used in combination with the GKG or other analysis to \nidentify further characteristics and attributes of the actor.  NOTE: due to processing performed \non each article, this may be slightly offset from the position seen when the article is rendered in \na web browser. \n\uf0b7 \nActor2CharOffset.  (integer)  The location within the article (in terms of English characters) \nwhere Actor2 was found.  This can be used in combination with the GKG or other analysis to \nidentify further characteristics and attributes of the actor.  NOTE: due to processing performed \non each article, this may be slightly offset from the position seen when the article is rendered in \na web browser. \n\uf0b7 \nActionCharOffset.  (integer)  The location within the article (in terms of English characters) \nwhere the core Action description was found.  This can be used in combination with the GKG or \nother analysis to identify further characteristics and attributes of the actor.  NOTE: due to \nprocessing performed on each article, this may be slightly offset from the position seen when \nthe article is rendered in a web browser. \n\uf0b7 \nInRawText.  (integer)  This records whether the event was found in the original unaltered raw \narticle text (a value of 1) or whether advanced natural language processing algorithms were \nrequired to synthesize and rewrite the article text to identify the event (a value of 0).  See the \ndiscussion on the Confidence field below for more details.  Mentions with a value of “1” in this \nfield likely represent strong detail-rich references to an event. \n\uf0b7 \nConfidence.  (integer)  Percent confidence in the extraction of this event from this article.  See \nthe discussion above. \n\uf0b7 \nMentionDocLen.  (integer)  The length in English characters of the source document (making it \npossible to filter for short articles focusing on a particular event versus long summary articles \nthat casually mention an event in passing). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionDocTone.  (integer)  The same contents as the AvgTone field in the Events table, but \ncomputed for this particular article.  NOTE: users interested in emotional measures should use'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'EVENT TABLE \n \nEVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe first few fields of an event record capture its globally unique identifier number, the date the event \ntook place on, and several alternatively formatted versions of the date designed to make it easier to \nwork with the event records in different analytical software programs that may have specific date \nformat requirements.  The parenthetical after each variable name gives the datatype of that field. \n \nNote that even though GDELT 2.0 operates at a 15 minute resolution, the date fields in this section still \nrecord the date at the daily level, since this is the resolution that event analysis has historically been \nperformed at.  To examine events at the 15 minute resolution, use the DATEADDED field (the second \nfrom the last field in this table at the end).  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer) Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely \nidentifies it in the master dataset.  NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is \nNOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields \nshould be used for this.  NOTE: There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 \nand February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0 – these are not missing events, the ID \nsequence was simply reset at a higher number so that it is possible to easily distinguish events \ncreated after the switchover to GDELT 2.0 from those created using the older GDELT 1.0 system. \n\uf0b7 \nDay.  (integer) Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.  See DATEADDED field for \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS date. \n\uf0b7 \nMonthYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYYMM format. \n\uf0b7 \nYear.  (integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYY format. \n\uf0b7 \nFractionDate.  (floating point) Alternative formatting of the event date, computed as YYYY.FFFF, \nwhere FFFF is the percentage of the year completed by that day.  This collapses the month and \nday into a fractional range from 0 to 0.9999, capturing the 365 days of the year.  The fractional \ncomponent (FFFF) is computed as (MONTH * 30 + DAY) / 365.  This is an approximation and does \nnot correctly take into account the differing numbers of days in each month or leap years, but \noffers a simple single-number sorting mechanism for applications that wish to estimate the \nrough temporal distance between dates. \n \n \nACTOR ATTRIBUTES \n \nThe next fields describe attributes and characteristics of the two actors involved in the event.  This \nincludes the complete raw CAMEO code for each actor, its proper name, and associated attributes.  The \nraw CAMEO code for each actor contains an array of coded attributes indicating geographic, ethnic, and \nreligious affiliation and the actor’s role in the environment (political elite, military officer, rebel, etc).  \nThese 3-character codes may be combined in any order and are concatenated together to form the final \nraw actor CAMEO code.  To make it easier to utilize this information in analysis, this section breaks these \ncodes out into a set of individual fields that can be separately queried.  NOTE: all attributes in this \nsection other than CountryCode are derived from the TABARI ACTORS dictionary and are NOT \nsupplemented from information in the text.  Thus, if the text refers to a group as “Radicalized'
 'shortform of the state’s name (such as “TX” for Texas).  Note: see the notice above for \nCountryCode regarding the FIPS10-4 / GENC transition.  Note: to obtain ADM2 (district-\nlevel) assignments for locations, you can either perform a spatial join against a ShapeFile \ntemplate in any GIS software, or cross-walk the FeatureID to the GNIS/GNS databases – \nthis will provide additional fields such as ADM2 codes and MGRS grid references for \nGNS. \no Location Latitude.  (floating point number) This is the centroid latitude of the landmark \nfor mapping.  In the case of a country or administrative division this will reflect the \ncentroid of that entire country/division. \no Location Longitude.  (floating point number) This is the centroid longitude of the \nlandmark for mapping.  In the case of a country or administrative division this will reflect \nthe centroid of that entire country/division. \no Location FeatureID.  (text OR signed integer) This is the numeric GNS or GNIS FeatureID \nfor this location OR a textual country or ADM1 code.  More information on these values \ncan be found in Leetaru (2012).4  Note: This field will be blank or contain a textual ADM1 \ncode for country or ADM1-level matches – see above.  Note: For numeric GNS or GNIS \nFeatureIDs, this field can contain both positive and negative numbers, see Leetaru \n(2012) for more information on this. \n\uf0b7 \nV2ENHANCEDLOCATIONS.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with pound symbol (“#”) delimited \nfields)  This field is identical to the V1LOCATIONS field with the primary exception of an extra \nfield appended to the end of each location block after its FeatureID that lists the approximate \ncharacter offset of the reference to that location in the text.  In addition, if a location appears \nmultiple times in the article, it will be listed multiple times in this field.  The only other \nmodification from V1LOCATIONS is the addition of a single new field “Location ADM2Code” in \nbetween “Location ADM1Code” and “Location Latitude”. 5  NOTE: there was an error in this field \nfrom 2/19/2015 through midday 3/1/2015 that caused the CountryCode field to list the wrong \ncountry code in some cases. \n\uf0b7 \nV1PERSONS.  (semicolon-delimited)  This is the list of all person names found in the text, \nextracted through the Leetaru (2012) algorithm. 6  This name recognition algorithm is unique in \nthat it is specially designed to recognize the African, Asian, and Middle Eastern names that yield \nsignificantly reduced accuracy with most name recognition engines.  This field is identical in \nformat and population as the corresponding field in the GKG 1.0  format. \n\uf0b7 \nV2ENHANCEDPERSONS.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This \ncontains a list of all person names referenced in the document, along with the character offsets \nof approximately where in the document they were found.  Each person reference is separated \nby a semicolon, and within each reference, the person name is specified first, followed by a \ncomma, and then the approximate character offset of the reference of that person in the \ndocument, allowing it to be associated with other entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that \nappear in closest proximity to it.  If a person is mentioned multiple times in a document, each \nmention will appear separately in this field. \n\uf0b7 \nV1ORGANIZATIONS.  (semicolon-delimited)  This is the list of all company and organization \nnames found in the text, extracted through the Leetaru (2012) algorithm. 7  This is a \ncombination of corporations, IGOs, NGOs, and any other local organizations such as a local fair \n                                                          \n4 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n5 http://blog.gdeltproject.org/global-second-order-administrative-divisions-now-available-from-gaul/ \n6 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n7 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","['INTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.

The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","The main differences between GKG 1.0 and the newer versions (such as GKG 2.1) in terms of data format and usage are as follows:

1. **Data Format and Structure:**
   - **File Format:** Both GKG 1.0 and newer versions use a tab-delimited format with a "".csv"" file extension (despite being tab-delimited) to facilitate fast scanning and parallelized parsing. However, the newer versions have substantially changed the ordering of fields compared to GKG 1.0.
   - **Field Naming and Versioning:** Newer versions use prefixes like V1, V1.5, and V2 to indicate whether fields are identical to, slightly changed from, or new compared to the original GKG 1.0 format. This helps maintain backward compatibility while introducing new features.
   - **Unique Record Identifiers:** GKG 2.1 introduces a globally unique GKGRECORDID string that encodes the date and time of the update batch and a sequential number, including a marker for translated documents. This is different from GKG 1.0, which did not have such a detailed unique identifier system.

2. **Content and Metadata Enhancements:**
   - **Date Format:** GKG 1.0 used a simpler date format (YYYYMMDD), while GKG 2.1 uses a more precise date-time format (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) for the publication date of the source document.
   - **Expanded Source Document Identification:** The newer versions include a more detailed MentionIdentifier field that can contain URLs, textual citations, or DOIs, depending on the MentionType, allowing for more precise and varied document referencing.
   - **Enhanced Location Data:** The newer versions add fields like V2ENHANCEDLOCATIONS, which include additional geographic metadata such as ADM2 codes and character offsets of location mentions in the text, improving geographic precision and enabling better spatial analysis.
   - **Enhanced Person and Organization Data:** GKG 2.1 introduces V2ENHANCEDPERSONS, which not only lists person names but also includes character offsets for each mention, allowing for more granular text analysis and association with other metadata fields. This is an enhancement over the simpler semicolon-delimited lists in GKG 1.0.
   - **Removal of NUMARTS Field:** The NUMARTS field present in GKG 1.0, which indicated the number of articles clustered together, was discontinued in newer versions due to the support for multiple source collections and the need to specify source collections explicitly.

3. **Usage and Processing:**
   - **Complexity and Preprocessing:** The newer GKG formats are designed to support a wider array of complex analytic needs and multiple source types beyond just news media. This requires more sophisticated preprocessing and scripting (e.g., using Python or PERL) to extract and transform the data for statistical or network analysis.
   - **Backward Compatibility:** Most fields from GKG 1.0 are preserved in the newer versions to maintain backward compatibility, but users must be aware of changes in field order and new fields when processing the data.
   - **Increased Scope and Detail:** The newer versions expand the scope of the GKG to include latent dimensions of society, emotional and thematic scores, and more detailed metadata, enabling richer and more nuanced analyses than were possible with GKG 1.0.

In summary, the newer GKG versions improve upon GKG 1.0 by providing more detailed, precise, and varied metadata fields, enhanced geographic and entity information, a more robust unique identifier system, and a more complex but flexible data format designed for advanced analytical use cases.","The GKG 1.0 system was the original prototype introduced on November 3, 2013, and it has been used in a wide variety of fields due to its unique indicators capturing latent dimensions of society. The newer GKG Version 2.1 expands on this by integrating new features and moving the system into production status from its original alpha status. While the new format preserves most of the previous fields for backwards compatibility and continues to generate daily Version 1.0 files in parallel, the GKG 2.1 format is optimized for fast scanning using a tab-delimited CSV format with one record per line, enabling highly parallelized streamed parsing.

Can you explane how RID is used in the GDELT GCAM module for emotion analysis?,"['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'

It will be blank for documents originally in English.  At this time the field will also be \nblank for documents translated by a human translator and provided to GDELT in English (such as \nBBC Monitoring materials) – in future this field may be expanded to include information on \nhuman translation pipelines, but at present it only captures information on machine translated \nmaterials.  An example of the contents of this field might be “srclc:fra; eng:Moses 2.1.1 / \nMosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0”.  NOTE:  Machine translation is often not as accurate as \nhuman translation and users requiring the highest possible confidence levels may wish to \nexclude events whose only mentions are in translated reports, while those needing the highest-\npossible coverage of the non-Western world will find that these events often offer the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or smaller-bore events of less interest to Western media.   \no SRCLC.

This is a textual citation string that indicates the engine(s) and model(s) used to \ntranslate the text.  The format of this field will vary across engines and over time and no \nexpectations should be made on the ordering or formatting of this field.  In the example \nabove, the string “Moses 2.1.1 / MosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0” indicates that \nthe document was translated using version 2.1.1 of the Moses 7 SMT platform, using the \n“MosesCore Europarl fr-en” translation and language models, with the final translation \nenhanced via GDELT Translingual’s own version 1.0 French translation and language \nmodels.  A value of “GT-ARA 1.0” indicates that GDELT Translingual’s version 1.0 Arabic \ntranslation and language models were the sole resources used for translation.  \nAdditional language systems used in the translation pipeline such as word segmentation \nsystems are also captured in this field such that a value of “GT-ZHO 1.0 / Stanford PKU” \nindicates that the Stanford Chinese Word Segmenter 8 was used to segment the text \ninto individual words and sentences, which were then translated by GDELT \nTranslingual’s own version 1.0 Chinese (Traditional or Simplified) translation and \nlanguage models. \n\uf0b7 \nExtras.

 'Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field'

This can be used as a method of filtering the \n“context” of events as a subtle measure of the importance of an event and as a proxy for the \n“impact” of that event.  For example, a riot event with a slightly negative average tone is likely \nto have been a minor occurrence, whereas if it had an extremely negative average tone, it \nsuggests a far more serious occurrence.  A riot with a positive score likely suggests a very minor'
 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,']","['Date Mentions. We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references found in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates as possible “anniversary violence” indicators. All day, month, and year dates are now extracted from each document. \uf0b7 Proximity Context. Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the introduction of the new Proximity Context capability. The GKG records an enormously rich array']","In version 1.0 of the GKG (Global Knowledge Graph) data format, one of the most significant changes introduced was the addition of the **Proximity Context** capability. This new feature fundamentally enhanced the richness and granularity of the data recorded in the GKG.

### Proximity Context Capability

- **What it is:** Proximity Context refers to the detailed recording of the relative positions of key elements within a news article or document. Specifically, it captures the locations (in terms of character offsets or sentence numbers) where actors, actions, and other event components are mentioned within the text.
  
- **Impact on Data Encoding:** This capability allows the GKG to encode not just the presence of date mentions, actors, and events, but also their precise contextual placement within the article. For example, it records the exact character offset where Actor1, Actor2, and the core Action description appear, as well as the sentence number of the event mention.

- **Why it matters:** By knowing the proximity of these elements, analysts can better understand the narrative structure and the relationships between entities in the text. This is crucial for disambiguating ambiguous references (e.g., pronouns like ""he"" or ""his"") and for assessing the importance or emphasis of an event within an article based on its position.

### Encoding Date Mentions

- Version 1.0 also introduced the explicit extraction and encoding of **date mentions** found in news articles and documents. This means that all day, month, and year references are now systematically extracted from each document.

- **Use case:** This is particularly useful for identifying ""anniversary violence"" or recurring events that are referenced repeatedly in the media. By encoding these date mentions, the GKG enables tracking of how specific dates are discussed over time, which can reveal patterns or cycles in news coverage.

### Overall Significance

- The combination of Proximity Context and date mention encoding represents a major step forward in the detail and usability of the GKG data. It allows for more nuanced analysis of news content, including better event disambiguation, temporal pattern recognition, and understanding of narrative emphasis.

- These enhancements support more sophisticated natural language processing and event extraction, improving the accuracy and depth of insights that can be drawn from global news media.

In summary, version 1.0's introduction of Proximity Context and systematic date mention extraction significantly improved the GKG's ability to encode and analyze the structure and timing of events in news articles, enabling richer and more precise global media analytics.","Version 1.0 introduced a major change with the addition of the Proximity Context capability, which represents the greatest change to the overall format. This version also enhanced the extraction of date mentions by encoding all day, month, and year dates found in news articles and documents. This allows for the identification of repeating mentions of specific dates, which can serve as potential indicators of ""anniversary violence.""

How does the GKG 2.1 system improve the association of John Kerry with his functional role and geographic context compared to the previous GKG system?,"['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'

The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.

An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'terrorists,” but the TABARI ACTORS dictionary labels that group as “Insurgents,” the latter label will be \nused. Use the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph to enrich actors with additional information from the rest \nof the article.  NOTE: the CountryCode field reflects a combination of information from the TABARI \nACTORS dictionary and text, with the ACTORS dictionary taking precedence, and thus if the text refers to \n“French Assistant Minister Smith was in Moscow,” the CountryCode field will list France in the \nCountryCode field, while the geographic fields discussed at the end of this manual may list Moscow as \nhis/her location.  NOTE: One of the two actor fields may be blank in complex or single-actor situations or \nmay contain only minimal detail for actors such as “Unidentified gunmen.” \n \nGDELT currently uses the CAMEO version 1.1b3 taxonomy.

In the case of the example article above, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to the others. In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other connectivity can be explored. Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity indicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations. \uf0b7 Over 100 New GKG Themes. There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating oil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social issues like marginalization and burning in effigy. The list of recognized infectious diseases, ethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 global humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global currencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking species migration and poaching. \uf0b7 Extensible XML Block. GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for its source material. Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage across the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures. As GDELT encodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and government reports, additional types of information are available to codify. As a first example of this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion words of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and the Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East. Academic literature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the papers cited within that paper. This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation graphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts. Yet, such citation lists are unique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it would be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these kinds of specialized data types. Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called V2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are applicable only to subsets of the collection. Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode highly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \uf0b7']","The GKG 2.1 system improves the association of John Kerry with his functional role and geographic context compared to the previous GKG system by introducing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object within the original article. 

In the previous GKG system, while it could identify that John Kerry, Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, the United States, Russia, and roles such as President and Secretary of State were mentioned in the same article, it could not associate each person with their corresponding location or functional role. For example, it could not link John Kerry specifically to the role of Secretary of State or to the United States geographically.

GKG 2.1 addresses this limitation by providing the character offsets of each mention, allowing for proximity-based contextualization. This means that the system can determine that mentions of the United States occur closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, and that the role ""Secretary of State"" is mentioned closer to John Kerry than to the others. This proximity information enables users to explore and recover functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations more effectively.

Thus, GKG 2.1 enhances the ability to associate individuals like John Kerry with their specific roles and geographic contexts by leveraging the spatial proximity of mentions within the text, which was not possible in the earlier version.","The GKG 2.1 system improves the association of John Kerry with his functional role and geographic context by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article.

how the GDELT Event Database integration improved by adding unique record identifiers to the GKG and why they remove the counts-only file in the GDELT Event Database context?,"['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.

 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.

 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","['<1-hop>\n\n\uf0b7 Single Data File.

Specifically:

- **Unique Record Identifiers (GKGRECORDID):** Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier in the form “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX,” where the first part encodes the date and time of the 15-minute update batch and the suffix is a sequential number for records within that batch. This allows users to uniquely identify and refer to individual GKG records, facilitating better data management, linking, and integration with the GDELT Event Database.

- This addition aligns the GKG with the practices used in the GDELT Event Database, improving consistency and enabling easier cross-referencing between datasets.

Regarding the removal of the counts-only file in the GDELT Event Database context:

- **Elimination of the Counts-Only File:** Previously, there were two separate GKG data files: one containing only counts and a smaller size, and another containing the full GKG data with thematic and other contextual fields. The rationale for having a counts-only file was to provide a smaller file for users interested only in counts.

- However, in practice, nearly all applications use the full GKG file because the thematic and contextual data are essential for understanding and contextualizing the counts and for linking them to the GDELT Event Database.

- Therefore, the counts-only file was removed to simplify the GKG data environment, reducing complexity for users and encouraging use of the richer, full GKG dataset.

**Summary:**

- Adding unique record identifiers to the GKG improved the ability to uniquely reference and manage individual records, enhancing integration with the Event Database and overall data usability.

- The counts-only file was removed because most users require the full contextual data, making the smaller counts-only file redundant and simplifying the data environment by maintaining only the full GKG file.","The GDELT Event Database integration improved by adding unique record identifiers to the GKG, aligning it with the event database practices.

In cases where it is necessary to collapse by \nfeature, the Geo_FeatureID column should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column.  This \nis because the Geo_Fullname column captures the name of the location as expressed in the text \nand thus reflects differences in transliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for \nthe same location.  For example, Mecca is often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly \nspelled Jiddah or Jaddah.  The Geo_Fullname column will reflect each of these different \nspellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the same unique GNS or GNIS \nfeature identification number.

NOTE: this field refers only to the first \nnews report to mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context \nin other news reports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the \npositioning of an event, see the Mentions table.  NOTE: this provides only a basic tonal \nassessment of an article and it is recommended that users interested in emotional measures use \nthe Mentions and Global Knowledge Graph tables to merge the complete set of 2,300 emotions \nand themes from the GKG GCAM system into their analysis of event records. \n \nEVENT GEOGRAPHY \n \nThe final set of fields add a novel enhancement to the CAMEO taxonomy, georeferencing each event \nalong three primary dimensions to the landmark-centroid level.  To do this, the fulltext of the source \ndocument is processed using fulltext geocoding and automatic disambiguation to identify every \ngeographic reference.3  The closest reference to each of the two actors and to the action reference are \nthen encoded in these fields.  The georeferenced location for an actor may not always match the \nActor1_CountryCode or Actor2_CountryCode field, such as in a case where the President of Russia is \nvisiting Washington, DC in the United States, in which case the Actor1_CountryCode would contain the \ncode for Russia, while the georeferencing fields below would contain a match for Washington, DC.  It \nmay not always be possible for the system to locate a match for each actor or location, in which case \none or more of the fields may be blank.  The Action fields capture the location information closest to the \npoint in the event description that contains the actual statement of action and is the best location to use \nfor placing events on a map or in other spatial context.   \n \nTo find all events located in or relating to a specific city or geographic landmark, the Geo_FeatureID \ncolumn should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column.  This is because the Geo_Fullname \ncolumn captures the name of the location as expressed in the text and thus reflects differences in \ntransliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for the same location.  For example, Mecca \nis often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly spelled Jiddah or Jaddah.  The Geo_Fullname column \nwill reflect each of these different spellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the \nsame unique GNS or GNIS feature identification number.  For more information on the GNS and GNIS \nidentifiers, see Leetaru (2012). 4 \n \nWhen looking for events in or relating to a specific country, such as Syria, there are two possible filtering \nmethods.  The first is to use the Actor_CountryCode fields in the Actor section to look for all actors \nhaving the SYR (Syria) code.  However, conflict zones are often accompanied by high degrees of \nuncertainty in media reporting and a news article might mention only “Unidentified gunmen stormed a \nhouse and shot 12 civilians.”  In this case, the Actor_CountryCode fields for Actor1 and Actor2 would \nboth be blank, since the article did not specify the actor country affiliations, while their \nGeo_CountryCode values (and the ActorGeo_CountryCode for the event) would specify Syria.  This can \nresult in dramatic differences when examining active conflict zones.  The second method is to examine \nthe ActorGeo_CountryCode for the location of the event.  This will also capture situations such as the \nUnited States criticizing a statement by Russia regarding a specific Syrian attack. \n \n                                                          \n3 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n4 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html'

Our findings demonstrate the significant value of combining the strengths of both approaches.\nWe believe that by combining news articles in the form of a vector store with the rich ontological structure of\nthe GDELT knowledge graph through an LLM interface, the resulting information extraction system would\nallow for better knowledge retrieval than either component alone. Specifically, the direct knowledge graph\n(DKG) excels at answering high-level or aggregate questions, providing a strong foundation of structured\nknowledge. While the vector store is well-suited for identifying local information within the documents that\nmight be missing or less readily accessible in the DKG, GraphRAG has shown effectiveness on both local and\nglobal information. Therefore, we hypothesize that the optimal approach is the integrated system, leveraging\nthe DKG for broad context and the vector store and GraphRAG for detailed, document-specific insights,\nand for enhanced global information retrieval. Further work must be done to determine the extent to which\nthe textual article data can be used to refine the KG produced here; some of our examples showed that\ninformation stored in the DKG does not truthfully reflect the information in the articles. Conversely, we\nmust determine how the constructed KG can be used to better search the associated vector store. Some of\nthese research directions include the following:\n• Use LLMs to add new information to an existing KG by creating new entities or edge relations. Based\noff our observations with LlamaIndex and GraphRAG, we need careful monitoring to ensure that the\nLLM formats its responses to properly adhere to the ontological structures and other existing structures\nin the KG. To this end, it can be beneficial to adapt the triples in the DKG produced here to fine-tune\nthe language model or guide its output with in-context learning.\n• By introducing RAG capabilities, we can fact check the KG against the raw textual information. For\nexample, we found that Niki Fennoy was only mentioned in 3 articles but misattributed to 11 others.\nThe use of LLMs give a potential avenue to fact-check existing relations.\n5\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is under information release number PNNL-SA-209193.\n10']","['<1-hop>\n\nproximity to it.

### Extraction of Location Names:
- The algorithm aggressively extracts every possible locative referent from the text, which may result in a slightly elevated level of false positives.
- Locations are identified and represented with multiple fields including:
  - **Location Type:** Specifies the geographic resolution (e.g., country, US state, US city, world city, world state).
  - **Location FullName:** The exact name as expressed in the text, capturing alternative spellings and transliterations (e.g., Mecca vs. Makkah).
  - **Location FeatureID:** A unique identifier from the GNS or GNIS databases that resolves different spellings or names to the same geographic feature.
  - **Location CountryCode, ADM1Code, ADM2Code:** Codes that provide hierarchical administrative information about the location.
  - **Latitude and Longitude:** Centroid coordinates for mapping the location.
- The algorithm uses these identifiers and codes to disambiguate locations and to allow filtering by geographic specificity.
- For accurate identification, the **FeatureID** is preferred over the textual name to collapse or unify references to the same location despite spelling variations.
- The algorithm also provides enhanced location fields (V2ENHANCEDLOCATIONS) that include character offsets of location mentions in the text and multiple mentions of the same location.

### Extraction of Organization Names:
- The algorithm extracts all company and organization names found in the text, including corporations, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local organizations.
- These are listed in a semicolon-delimited format similar to the person names extraction.
- The extraction is based on the same Leetaru (2012) algorithm, which is designed to handle diverse naming conventions and entity types.

### Specific Considerations for Accurate Identification:
- **Aggressiveness in Location Extraction:** The algorithm runs in a more aggressive stance to capture all possible locative references, which can increase false positives, so users should be aware of this trade-off.
- **Disambiguation Using FeatureIDs:** Because locations can have multiple accepted formal or informal names and alternative spellings, the algorithm relies on unique GNS/GNIS FeatureIDs to unify these variants.
- **Hierarchical Administrative Codes:** Use of ADM1 and ADM2 codes helps in precisely locating administrative divisions and districts, which is important for detailed geographic resolution.
- **Character Offsets:** Enhanced fields include character offsets to link entity mentions to their exact positions in the text, facilitating contextual analysis and cross-referencing with other extracted entities.
- **Handling of Different Geographic Resolutions:** The algorithm distinguishes between country-level, state-level, and city-level matches, providing centroid coordinates accordingly.
- **Specialized Person Name Recognition:** Although not directly about locations or organizations, the algorithm also includes a unique name recognition component designed to improve accuracy for African, Asian, and Middle Eastern names, indicating a broader attention to diverse naming conventions that likely extends to organizations and locations.

In summary, the Leetaru (2012) algorithm extracts location and organization names by combining aggressive entity recognition with detailed geographic coding and unique feature identifiers to accurately identify and disambiguate entities, while providing metadata such as character offsets and hierarchical administrative codes to support precise mapping and analysis.","The Leetaru (2012) algorithm is employed to extract both location and organization names from text.

"how GKG data enhancements like realtime measurement of 2,300 emotions and themes relate to the GKG file format evolution from 2.0 to 2.1 and what changes in article inclusion criteria support these enhancements?","['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html']","['<1-hop>\n\nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 The GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were released in that format. With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has remained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of significant enhancements to the GKG system. While it was originally intended to release these new features in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these fields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and the need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical representation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to accommodate these goals. Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to the GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification. Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of special subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 compatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be supported for news content. From a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 revolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the GKG stream. Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event stream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG metadata. Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would be grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2. With the introduction of the new GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear that the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, themes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very different GCAM scores. In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture necessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level. Thus, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of extracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the GKG stream. The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering. In addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article to appear in the GKG. Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output. However, many topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy discussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a single location. This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of high relevance to many GDELT user communities. Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in the GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional scores. An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 '<2-hop>\n\nadds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening entirely new analytic opportunities. Some of the most significant changes: \uf0b7 Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes. The GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment analysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual dimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, French, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Urdu). GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents and reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from LIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \uf0b7 Realtime Translation of 65 Languages. GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT Translingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine translation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, representing 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into English for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines. GDELT Translingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the very first glimpses of a world without language barriers. The GKG system now processes every news report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \uf0b7 Relevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds. A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now specify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that represents the core focus of the article. GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats. In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \uf0b7 Quotes, Names, and Amounts. The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food prices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable item. GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to offer numeric context to global events. In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative. Finally, GDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the evolving language used by political leadership across the world. \uf0b7']","The enhancements in GKG data, such as the realtime measurement of over 2,300 emotions and themes through the GCAM (Global Content Analysis Measures) module, are directly related to the evolution of the GKG file format from version 2.0 to 2.1. These enhancements necessitated changes in the file format and article inclusion criteria to support the richer, more granular data.

**Relation of GCAM Enhancements to GKG File Format Evolution (2.0 to 2.1):**

- **New Fields Added:**  
  GKG 2.1 introduced several new fields to accommodate significant enhancements like GCAM's realtime emotional and thematic measurements. While initially planned to be included in the V2EXTRASXML field in GKG 2.0, the integral nature of these fields and the need for better alignment with the Events dataset format required a formal upgrade to GKG 2.1. This upgrade allowed structural mapping and hierarchical representation of these new data dimensions.

- **Document-Level Metadata:**  
  The GCAM system assesses emotions and themes at the individual article level, which required the GKG 2.1 format to stop clustering multiple articles with identical metadata into a single record (as was done in GKG 1.0 and 2.0). Instead, GKG 2.1 records each article separately, preserving unique GCAM scores and metadata per document. This change supports the detailed emotional and thematic analysis enabled by GCAM.

- **Unique Record Identifiers:**  
  To manage the increased granularity and to uniquely identify each article's metadata (including GCAM scores), GKG 2.1 assigns a globally unique identifier (GKGRECORDID) to each record.

**Changes in Article Inclusion Criteria Supporting These Enhancements:**

- **Relaxed Geographic Location Requirement:**  
  Previously (in GKG 1.0 and 2.0), an article had to contain at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included in the GKG. This excluded many relevant articles on topics without strong geographic references (e.g., cybersecurity, constitutional discourse).

- **Inclusion Based on Any Extracted Information:**  
  Starting with GKG 2.1, an article is included if it contains *any* successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional and thematic scores. This means articles without geographic mentions but with emotional or thematic metadata are now included, broadening the scope and relevance of the GKG data.

- **No Clustering of Articles:**  
  Because GCAM scores can vary significantly even among articles sharing the same locations, themes, people, and organizations, GKG 2.1 treats each article as a separate entry rather than clustering them. This preserves the unique emotional and thematic context of each article.

**Summary:**

- The realtime measurement of 2,300+ emotions and themes by GCAM required GKG to evolve from 2.0 to 2.1 to structurally support these new data fields and to align better with event data formats.
- GKG 2.1 stopped clustering articles with identical metadata to preserve unique emotional/thematic scores per article.
- The article inclusion criteria were broadened in GKG 2.1 to include articles without geographic locations but with any extracted metadata, including GCAM scores, enabling richer and more comprehensive data coverage.

These changes collectively enable the GKG to provide a more nuanced, detailed, and comprehensive representation of global news content, including emotional and thematic undercurrents at a planetary scale.","The GKG file format evolved from 2.0 to 2.1 to accommodate significant enhancements in the GKG system, including the addition of several new fields designed to align with the Events dataset format and enable structural mapping for a new hierarchical representation. One major enhancement is the realtime measurement of more than 2,300 emotions and themes through the GCAM module, which assesses emotional undercurrents in multiple languages. To support this, the GKG 2.1 format no longer clusters documents based on shared metadata as in 1.0, allowing each article's unique GCAM scores to be preserved. Additionally, the minimum inclusion criteria changed: whereas GKG 1.0 and 2.0 required at least one geocoded location for an article to be included, GKG 2.1 includes any article with successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores, even if no geographic mentions exist. These changes in the file format and inclusion criteria directly support the enhanced analytic capabilities introduced by the realtime emotion and theme measurements.",0.8235294117647058,0.886174208437601,0.99999999998,1.0
how event sourcing with DATEADDED field help event tracking in mentions table when news report mention same event many times and how confidence in extraction important for tracking event sourcing and event tracking,"['Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field'
 'records GDELT’s confidence in its extraction of that event from that particular article.  This field is a \npercent, ranging from 10 to 100% and indicates how aggressively GDELT had to perform tasks like \ncoreference or grammatical restructuring to extract the event from that article.  Sorting all mentions of \nan event by this field makes it possible to identify articles featuring the strongest and most \nunambiguous discussion of an event. \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer)  This is the ID of the event that was mentioned in the article. \n\uf0b7 \nEventTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the \nevent being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT (the DATEADDED field of the original event \nrecord).  This field can be compared against the next one to identify events being mentioned for \nthe first time (their first mentions) or to identify events of a particular vintage being mentioned \nnow (such as filtering for mentions of events at least one week old). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) of the \ncurrent update.  This is identical for all entries in the update file but is included to make it easier \nto load the Mentions table into a database.   \n\uf0b7 \nMentionType.  (integer)  This is a numeric identifier that refers to the source collection the \ndocument came from and is used to interpret the MentionIdentifier in the next column.  In \nessence, it specifies how to interpret the MentionIdentifier to locate the actual document.  At \npresent, it can hold one of the following values: \no 1 = WEB (The document originates from the open web and the MentionIdentifier is a \nfully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web). \no 2 = CITATIONONLY (The document originates from a broadcast, print, or other offline \nsource in which only a textual citation is available for the document.  In this case the \nMentionIdentifier contains the textual citation for the document). \no 3 = CORE (The document originates from the CORE archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the CORE \nwebsite). \no 4 = DTIC (The document originates from the DTIC archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the DTIC website). \no 5 = JSTOR (The document originates from the JSTOR archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through your JSTOR \nsubscription if your institution subscribes to it). \no 6 = NONTEXTUALSOURCE (The document originates from a textual proxy (such as closed \ncaptioning) of a non-textual information source (such as a video) available via a URL and \nthe MentionIdentifier provides the URL of the non-textual original source.  At present, \nthis Collection Identifier is used for processing of the closed captioning streams of the \nInternet Archive Television News Archive in which each broadcast is available via a URL, \nbut the URL offers access only to the video of the broadcast and does not provide any \naccess to the textual closed captioning used to generate the metadata.

GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 'Conflict.  This field specifies this primary classification for the event type, allowing analysis at the \nhighest level of aggregation.  The numeric codes in this field map to the Quad Classes as follows: \n1=Verbal Cooperation, 2=Material Cooperation, 3=Verbal Conflict, 4=Material Conflict. \n\uf0b7 \nGoldsteinScale.  (floating point) Each CAMEO event code is assigned a numeric score from -10 to \n+10, capturing the theoretical potential impact that type of event will have on the stability of a \ncountry.  This is known as the Goldstein Scale.  This field specifies the Goldstein score for each \nevent type.  NOTE: this score is based on the type of event, not the specifics of the actual event \nrecord being recorded – thus two riots, one with 10 people and one with 10,000, will both \nreceive the same Goldstein score.  This can be aggregated to various levels of time resolution to \nyield an approximation of the stability of a location over time. \n\uf0b7 \nNumMentions.  (integer) This is the total number of mentions of this event across all source \ndocuments during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.  Multiple references to an \nevent within a single document also contribute to this count.  This can be used as a method of \nassessing the “importance” of an event: the more discussion of that event, the more likely it is \nto be significant.  The total universe of source documents and the density of events within them \nvary over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other \nmeasure of the universe of events during the time period of interest.  This field is actually a \ncomposite score of the total number of raw mentions and the number of mentions extracted \nfrom reprocessed versions of each article (see the discussion for the Mentions table).   NOTE: \nthis field refers only to the first news report to mention an event and is not updated if the event \nis found in a different context in other news reports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for \nmore precise information on the positioning of an event, see the Mentions table.  \n\uf0b7 \nNumSources.  (integer) This is the total number of information sources containing one or more \nmentions of this event during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.  This can be used \nas a method of assessing the “importance” of an event: the more discussion of that event, the \nmore likely it is to be significant.  The total universe of sources varies over time, so it is \nrecommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of \nevents during the time period of interest.  NOTE: this field refers only to the first news report to \nmention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context in other news \nreports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the positioning of \nan event, see the Mentions table. \n\uf0b7 \nNumArticles.  (integer) This is the total number of source documents containing one or more \nmentions of this event during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.  This can be used \nas a method of assessing the “importance” of an event: the more discussion of that event, the \nmore likely it is to be significant.  The total universe of source documents varies over time, so it \nis recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe \nof events during the time period of interest.  NOTE: this field refers only to the first news report \nto mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context in other news \nreports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the positioning of \nan event, see the Mentions table. \n\uf0b7 \nAvgTone.  (numeric) This is the average “tone” of all documents containing one or more \nmentions of this event during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.  The score \nranges from -100 (extremely negative) to +100 (extremely positive).  Common values range \nbetween -10 and +10, with 0 indicating neutral.  This can be used as a method of filtering the \n“context” of events as a subtle measure of the importance of an event and as a proxy for the \n“impact” of that event.  For example, a riot event with a slightly negative average tone is likely \nto have been a minor occurrence, whereas if it had an extremely negative average tone, it \nsuggests a far more serious occurrence.  A riot with a positive score likely suggests a very minor'

Only image-based embedded posts are \nincluded in this field – videos are identified in the following field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SOCIALVIDEOEMBEDS.    (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News websites are increasingly \nembedding videos inline in their articles to illustrate them with realtime reaction or citizen \nreporting from the ground.  Some news outlets that also have television properties may cross-\nlink their television reporting into their web-based presentation.  GDELT currently recognizes \nYouTube, DailyMotion, Vimeo, and Vine videos embedded in articles and records their URLs in \nthis field.  Similarly to the field above, this allows for a form of social media “curation” of the \nvideos deemed by the mainstream media to be of greatest relevance, significance, credibly, \nand/or interest to their audiences.   \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1QUOTATIONS.  (pound-delimited (“#”) blocks, with pipe-delimited (“|”) fields).  News \ncoverage frequently features excerpted statements from participants in an event and/or those \naffected by it and these quotations can offer critical insights into differing perspectives and \nemotions surrounding that event.  GDELT identifies and extracts all quoted statements from \neach article and additionally attempts to identify the verb introducing the quote to help lend \nadditional context, separating “John retorted…” from “John agreed…” to show whether the \nspeaker was agreeing with or rejecting the statement being made.  Each quoted statement is \nseparated by a “#” character, and within each block the following fields appear, separated by \npipe (“|”) symbols: \no Offset.  This is the character offset of the quoted statement within the document, \nindicating approximately where it was found in the body.  This can be used to associate \nthe date with the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest \nproximity to it. \no Length.  This is the length of the quoted statement in characters. \no Verb.  This is the verb used to introduce the quote, allowing for separation of \nagreement versus disagreement quotes.  May not be present for all quotes and not all \nverbs are recognized for this field. \no Quote.  The actual quotation itself. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1ALLNAMES.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This field contains \na list of all proper names referenced in the document, along with the character offsets of \napproximately where in the document they were found.  Unlike the V2ENHANCEDPERSONS and \nV2ENHANCEDORGANIZATIONS fields, which are restricted to person and organization names, \nrespectively, this field records ALL proper names referenced in the article, ranging from named \nevents like the Orange Revolution, Umbrella Movement, and Arab Spring, to movements like the \nCivil Rights Movement, to festivals and occurrences like the Cannes Film Festival and World Cup, \nto named wars like World War I, to named dates like Martin Luther King Day and Holocaust \nRemembrance Day, to named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act \nand Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  This field goes beyond people and organizations to \ncapturing a much broader view of the named events, objects, initiatives, laws, and other types \nof names in each article.  Each name reference is separated by a semicolon, and within each \nreference, the name is specified first, followed by a comma, and then the approximate character \noffset of the reference of that name in the document, allowing it to be associated with other \nentries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appear in closest proximity to it.  If a name is \nmentioned multiple times in a document, each mention will appear separately in this field.  This \nfield is designed to be maximally inclusive and in cases of ambiguity, to err on the side of \ninclusion of a name. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1AMOUNTS.

(string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this event in.

 '<2-hop>\n\nMENTIONS TABLE The Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event table, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the global media system. Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an event which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table. Mentions are recorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a year ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical events being recontextualized into present actions. If a news report mentions multiple events, each mention is recorded separately in this table. For translated documents, all measures below are based on its English translation. Several of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events based on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event. When trying to understand news media spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background knowledge, and complex linguistic structures. Not every event mention will take the form of “American President Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, France.” Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris yesterday for a trade summit. The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on Ukraine.” To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer? Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on Ukraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or perhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy? While additional cues may be available in the surrounding text, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media. Similarly, it would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire world and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor. Even in the case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in Port-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this disambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity. GDELT makes use of an array of natural language processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context. While these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically complex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error. Under GDELT 1.0, the NumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents mentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to six revision passes. Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the Mentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field']","Event sourcing with the **DATEADDED** field helps event tracking in the Mentions table by providing a precise timestamp (in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS UTC format) of when the event was first added to the master database. This timestamp allows users to:

- Identify the original occurrence time of the event at a 15-minute resolution.
- Distinguish between multiple mentions of the same event across different news reports over time.
- Track the trajectory and evolution of an event as it is mentioned repeatedly in various articles, including mentions long after the original event date (e.g., anniversary or historical references).
- Filter mentions by the event's original date to analyze mentions of events of a particular vintage or to identify first mentions versus subsequent mentions.

Since the Mentions table records each mention of an event separately, even if the same event is mentioned many times, the **EventTimeDate** field (which corresponds to the original event's DATEADDED) allows linking all these mentions back to the same event source. This enables comprehensive tracking of how an event is discussed and evolves in media over time.

---

The **Confidence** field in the Mentions table is crucial for event sourcing and event tracking because:

- It quantifies GDELT’s confidence in the accuracy of the event extraction from each individual article, expressed as a percentage from 10% to 100%.
- Higher confidence scores indicate mentions where the event extraction was less ambiguous and required fewer aggressive natural language processing interventions (like coreference resolution or grammatical restructuring).
- Sorting mentions by confidence allows users to prioritize or filter for the most reliable and unambiguous mentions of an event, improving the quality of event tracking.
- Since news reports often contain ambiguous language, pronouns, or complex references, the confidence score helps manage the uncertainty inherent in automated event extraction.
- This is especially important when the same event is mentioned multiple times with varying clarity; confidence scores help identify which mentions are most trustworthy for analysis.

Together, the **DATEADDED** field (event sourcing) and the **Confidence** field (extraction reliability) enable robust tracking of events through multiple mentions in the media, allowing analysts to trace the spread, evolution, and reliability of information about an event over time.","Event sourcing is supported by the DATEADDED field, which stores the date the event was added to the master database in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in UTC timezone, allowing queries at 15 minute resolution to access events precisely. This precise timestamping helps in event tracking within the Mentions table, which records each mention of events from the Event table, even if an event is mentioned multiple times across different articles or at different times. The Mentions table enables tracking the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through global media, including mentions of historical or anniversary events. Additionally, the Confidence field in the Mentions table is important because event mentions often contain linguistic ambiguities and complex references, making extraction challenging. GDELT uses natural language processing algorithms to disambiguate mentions, but this can introduce errors. Therefore, the Confidence measure helps filter and assess the reliability of event mentions, improving the accuracy of event sourcing and event tracking.",0.9523809523809523,0.9346587586309818,0.8666666666377778,1.0
how GKG 1.0 clustering and minimum article inclusion criteria different from GKG 2.0 and 2.1 and why these changes important for GKG system?,"['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'arXiv:2503.07584v3  [cs.IR]  24 Jun 2025\nTalking to GDELT Through Knowledge Graphs\nAudun Myers, Max Vargas, Sinan G. Aksoy, Cliff Joslyn, Benjamin Wilson,\nLee Burke, Tom Grimes\nAbstract\nIn this work we study various Retrieval Augmented Regeneration (RAG) approaches to gain an\nunderstanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in a question-answering analysis. To\ngain this understanding we use a case-study subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and\nTone (GDELT) dataset as well as a corpus of raw text scraped from the online news articles. To retrieve\ninformation from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art\nlarge language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the\nrelevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework\nfor constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema\nof GDELT to create structured representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from\nthe ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval\napproaches. We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that\nwhile our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant\nsubgraphs is challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries, often lack\nconsistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a synergistic approach between ontology\nand LLM-based KG construction, with proposed avenues toward that end.\n1\nIntroduction\nIn this work we study several approaches for communicating with a corpus of text via relevant text and\nknowledge graph (KG) representation and retrieval facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our\ngoal is to understand the benefits and drawbacks of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches to\ncorpus management and anlysis when combined with an LLM. Throughout we use as a case study a novel\nKG derived from the Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT)1 [13] dataset.\nAs a way to enhance LLM outputs, researchers and practitioners have been quick in applying LLMs to\nquery and understand proprietary data through retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) [14]. It has been\nshown that reasoning over the typical RAG framework, which only takes advantage of the unstructured text\narticles, fails to capture global information about the provided data [5, 27].\nMotivated by this limitation, there has been recent interest in adapting these techniques to the case where\nour data has a graph structure, so that the LLM can directly ingest important relationships in the knowledge\nbase [5, 7, 15, 31]. More specifically, KGs [8] are graph structures which are richly attributed with typing\nand semantic information on both nodes and edges. KG techniques provide ways to automatically query\nand extract information stored in a KG without the user explicitly needing to understand query languages\nto probe their knowledge base. Typically, these AI-based search algorithms find subgraphs that can be used\nto answer a user-provided query.\nThe interactions between KGs and LLMs have potential beyond merely question-answering and knowledge\nextraction (see different research directions outlined by Pan et al. [18]). In particular, reflective of KGs\nbeing used to enhance LLM outputs, LLMs can be used to enhance existing KGs or create new ones entirely\nfrom scratch. However, exploration of techniques to this end either (1) do not deal with imposing different\nontological structures in graph creation or (2) only focus on extracting ontological structures using LLMs\n1https://www.gdeltproject.org/\n1'
 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).']","['<1-hop>\n\nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 The GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were released in that format. With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has remained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of significant enhancements to the GKG system. While it was originally intended to release these new features in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these fields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and the need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical representation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to accommodate these goals. Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to the GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification. Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of special subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 compatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be supported for news content. From a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 revolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the GKG stream. Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event stream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG metadata. Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would be grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2. With the introduction of the new GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear that the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, themes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very different GCAM scores. In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture necessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level. Thus, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of extracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the GKG stream. The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering. In addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article to appear in the GKG. Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output. However, many topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy discussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a single location. This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of high relevance to many GDELT user communities. Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in the GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional scores. An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 '<2-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","The differences between GKG 1.0 clustering and minimum article inclusion criteria compared to GKG 2.0 and 2.1, and the importance of these changes for the GKG system, are as follows:

### Clustering Differences:
- **GKG 1.0:**  
  - Articles were clustered together if they had the same GKG metadata (i.e., the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations).  
  - Multiple articles with identical metadata were grouped into a single row, with a field (NumArticles) indicating the number of articles clustered.  
  - This deduplication was similar to the approach used in the Event stream.

- **GKG 2.0 and 2.1:**  
  - Clustering based on shared metadata was discontinued.  
  - Each article is represented as a separate entry, even if multiple articles share the same locations, themes, people, and organizations.  
  - This change was driven by the introduction of the GCAM system, which assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, meaning articles with the same metadata could have very different emotional/thematic scores.  
  - Additionally, real-time translation required the ability to track metadata provenance at the document level, which clustering would obscure.

### Minimum Article Inclusion Criteria Differences:
- **GKG 1.0 and 2.0:**  
  - An article had to contain at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included in the GKG output.  
  - Articles without geographic mentions were excluded.

- **GKG 2.1:**  
  - The geographic location requirement was removed.  
  - An article is included if it contains **any** successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores.  
  - This allows inclusion of articles that do not mention any geographic location but are still relevant, such as those discussing cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, or policy discussions.  
  - Articles with no geographic metadata but with emotional/thematic scores or mentions of political leaders or arguments are now included.

### Importance of These Changes for the GKG System:
- **Clustering Removal:**  
  - Enables more granular, document-level metadata representation, which is crucial given the complexity and variability introduced by GCAM emotional and thematic scoring.  
  - Supports real-time translation and provenance tracking, improving data accuracy and usability.  
  - Allows users to analyze each article individually rather than aggregated clusters, enhancing analytical precision.

- **Relaxed Inclusion Criteria:**  
  - Broadens the scope of the GKG to include a wider range of relevant content, especially for topics that lack strong geographic references.  
  - Increases the comprehensiveness and relevance of the GKG dataset for diverse user communities and research areas.  
  - Prevents exclusion of important thematic and emotional content that would otherwise be missed under the geographic location requirement.

In summary, the shift from clustering to individual article entries and the removal of the geographic location requirement in GKG 2.1 reflect the system’s evolution to handle richer, more nuanced metadata (like emotional scores) and to better serve a wider array of analytical needs, making the GKG more detailed, flexible, and inclusive.","The GKG 1.0 format applied a deduplication process that clustered together all articles yielding the same GKG metadata, grouping them into a single row with a NumArticles count. In contrast, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents based on shared metadata; instead, each article appears as a separate entry even if they share the same locations, themes, people, and organizations. This change was necessary because the new GCAM system assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, and articles with the same metadata might have very different GCAM scores. Additionally, real-time translation required identifying metadata provenance at the document level. Regarding minimum inclusion criteria, under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article had to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included. However, many important topics lack strong geographic centering and were excluded. Starting with GKG 2.1, an article is included if it contains any successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores, even if no geographic mentions are present. These changes are important because they allow the GKG system to better capture the full range of relevant content and metadata, improving its ability to represent global human society and support diverse analytic needs.",0.9795918367346939,0.9858811935421601,0.9999999999666667,1.0
"How do the unique record identifiers in the GKG align with the GDELT Event Database, and what role do the Confidence measures in the GDELT Event records play in filtering events for different use cases?","['Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field'

The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.

 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.

 '\uf0b7 \nMentionIdentifier.  (integer)  This is the unique external identifier for the source document.  It \ncan be used to uniquely identify the document and access it if you have the necessary \nsubscriptions or authorizations and/or the document is public access.  This field can contain a \nrange of values, from URLs of open web resources to textual citations of print or broadcast \nmaterial to DOI identifiers for various document repositories.  For example, if MentionType is \nequal to 1, this field will contain a fully-qualified URL suitable for direct access.  If MentionType \nis equal to 2, this field will contain a textual citation akin to what would appear in an academic \njournal article referencing that document (NOTE that the actual citation format will vary (usually \nbetween APA, Chicago, Harvard, or MLA) depending on a number of factors and no assumptions \nshould be made on its precise format at this time due to the way in which this data is currently \nprovided to GDELT – future efforts will focus on normalization of this field to a standard citation \nformat).  If MentionType is 3, the field will contain a numeric or alpha-numeric DOI that can be \ntyped into JSTOR’s search engine to access the document if your institution has a JSTOR \nsubscription. \n\uf0b7 \nSentenceID.

To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier. As with the event database, sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a record across the entire collection. The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will make it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. 1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 '<2-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their descriptions. GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, capturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2. A wide array of variables break out the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, the Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique array of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both actors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the story of each event “in flight” through the global media system. At present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, however in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 format. The Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note that files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited). With the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at least through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without modification. Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning February 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches back to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. There are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset. The first is the traditional Event table. This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several changes as noted below. In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records all mentions of each event. As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those mentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, including the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus being buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event from that specific news report. The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it possible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases. Those wishing to find the earliest glimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of period “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest events with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the highest Confidence measures. This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each individual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below). It also makes it possible to identify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those with the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific source language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).']","The unique record identifiers in the GKG (Global Knowledge Graph) align with the GDELT Event Database by providing a unique identifier for each GKG record, similar to how unique identifiers are assigned to event records in the Event Database. These identifiers uniquely identify records across the entire collection, facilitating easier referencing and integration between the GKG and the Event Database. Although sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, they ensure that each record can be distinctly identified, which helps in linking GKG records to corresponding events in the Event Database.

Regarding the role of Confidence measures in the GDELT Event records, these are new features introduced in GDELT 2.0, recorded in the Mentions table for each mention of an event in a news article. The Confidence measure represents the percent confidence that the natural language processing algorithms have in the accuracy of the event extraction from that specific article. Because news reports often contain ambiguous or linguistically complex descriptions of events, the Confidence score helps users filter events based on the reliability of the extraction.

This filtering capability allows users to tailor the event data stream to their specific needs:

- For use cases requiring the earliest detection of breaking or minor events, users can include all events regardless of Confidence, capturing even low-confidence mentions that might indicate emerging stories.
- For use cases focused on identifying only the most significant or well-documented events, users can filter the event stream to include only those mentions with the highest Confidence scores, ensuring stronger detail and accuracy.
- Additionally, Confidence scores can help identify the ""best"" news report for a given event by selecting mentions with the highest Confidence, most prominent article positioning, or specific source languages.

In summary, the unique record identifiers in the GKG align with the Event Database by providing consistent, unique references across datasets, while the Confidence measures in the Event records enable dynamic filtering of events to suit different analytical or operational requirements based on the certainty of event extraction.","The unique record identifiers in the GKG are assigned to each record to align with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, where every record is uniquely identified across the entire collection, although sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events. This addition makes it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. In the GDELT Event records, the Confidence measure is a new feature introduced in GDELT 2.0 that allows users to adjust the sensitivity of the dataset towards specific use cases. It enables filtering of the Event stream to find only the largest events with strongly detailed descriptions by selecting those with the highest Confidence measures, or to include smaller events by using the entire event stream. This dynamic filtering helps identify the 'best' news report for a given event by considering factors such as the highest Confidence scores, prominence within the article, and source language.",0.9333333333333333,0.9901232753058578,0.8666666666377778,1.0
how GDELT Global Knowledge Graph 2.1 improve role and location association and what new features it bring to GDELT Global Knowledge Graph?,"['THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 'terrorists,” but the TABARI ACTORS dictionary labels that group as “Insurgents,” the latter label will be \nused. Use the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph to enrich actors with additional information from the rest \nof the article.  NOTE: the CountryCode field reflects a combination of information from the TABARI \nACTORS dictionary and text, with the ACTORS dictionary taking precedence, and thus if the text refers to \n“French Assistant Minister Smith was in Moscow,” the CountryCode field will list France in the \nCountryCode field, while the geographic fields discussed at the end of this manual may list Moscow as \nhis/her location.  NOTE: One of the two actor fields may be blank in complex or single-actor situations or \nmay contain only minimal detail for actors such as “Unidentified gunmen.” \n \nGDELT currently uses the CAMEO version 1.1b3 taxonomy.  For more information on what each specific \ncode in the fields below stands for and the complete available taxonomy of the various fields below, \nplease see the CAMEO User Manual 1 or the GDELT website for crosswalk files.2 \n \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Code.  (string) The complete raw CAMEO code for Actor1 (includes geographic, class, \nethnic, religious, and type classes).  May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Name.  (string) The actual name of the Actor1.  In the case of a political leader or \norganization, this will be the leader’s formal name (GEORGE W BUSH, UNITED NATIONS), for a \ngeographic match it will be either the country or capital/major city name (UNITED STATES / \nPARIS), and for ethnic, religious, and type matches it will reflect the root match class (KURD, \nCATHOLIC, POLICE OFFICER, etc).  May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1CountryCode.  (string) The 3-character CAMEO code for the country affiliation of Actor1.  \nMay be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1 or determine its country affiliation \n(such as “UNIDENTIFIED GUNMEN”). \n\uf0b7 \nActor1KnownGroupCode. (string) If Actor1 is a known IGO/NGO/rebel organization (United \nNations, World Bank, al-Qaeda, etc) with its own CAMEO code, this field will contain that code. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1EthnicCode.  (string) If the source document specifies the ethnic affiliation of Actor1 and \nthat ethnic group has a CAMEO entry, the CAMEO code is entered here.  NOTE: a few special \ngroups like ARAB may also have entries in the type column due to legacy CAMEO behavior.  \nNOTE: this behavior is highly experimental and may not capture all affiliations properly – for \nmore comprehensive and sophisticated identification of ethnic affiliation, it is recommended \nthat users use the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph’s ethnic, religious, and social group \ntaxonomies and post-enrich actors from the GKG. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Religion1Code. (string) If the source document specifies the religious affiliation of Actor1 \nand that religious group has a CAMEO entry, the CAMEO code is entered here.  NOTE: a few \nspecial groups like JEW may also have entries in the geographic or type columns due to legacy \nCAMEO behavior.  NOTE: this behavior is highly experimental and may not capture all affiliations \nproperly – for more comprehensive and sophisticated identification of ethnic affiliation, it is \nrecommended that users use the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph’s ethnic, religious, and social \ngroup taxonomies and post-enrich actors from the GKG. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Religion2Code.  (string) If multiple religious codes are specified for Actor1, this contains \nthe secondary code.

 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 '[23, 28].\nThroughout this work we use the GDELT dataset as a case study.\nGDELT is a massive collection of\nnews reports that provide a real-time computational record of global events that is published every 15\nminutes. It aggregates information from various news sources, blogs, and social media platforms to construct\na large collection of data including information on people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions.\nEssentially, GDELT offers a snapshot of the world’s collective events, enabling researchers and analysts to\nexplore complex patterns and relationships within global society. By analyzing this data, it’s possible to\nidentify emerging trends, assess risks, understand public sentiment, and track the evolution of various issues\nover time. The applications of GDELT are diverse and far-reaching. Some of the most common use cases\nincluding event monitoring [16, 17, 29], risk assessment and prediction [6, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30], and social\nscience research [2, 3, 4, 12].\nGDELT describes its structure as a Global Knowledge Graph (GKG, specifically, we use the the Global\nKnowledge Graph edition 2 (GKG2) of GDELT). But in fact GDELT-GKG2 is implemented as multiple\nlinked tables recording information about the relationship between articles and events, and thus effectively\nhas the structure of a relational database. Another important contribution of this paper is to actually realize\nGKG2 properly in the mathematical form of a KG, effectively a graph database, derived from and consistent\nwith its native relational database form. To facilitate this effort, we have identified a lightweight ontology\nfor GDELT in the form of its graph schema, realizing its relational database schema in a KG form.\nUsing the KG that we construct from the GDELT-GKG2 dataset, we provide a case study to explore the\nutility of LLM-based tools to extract information and confirm that the KG can be used for question-answering\nin cases where traditional RAG fails. As part of our analysis, we compare to KGs produced from processing\nvarious news articles with an LLM, prompting it to try and adhere to a reduced version of the same ontology.\nThe current state of neurosymbolic work is noted for the plethora of experimental architectures available.\nWhile details are explicated below in Section 3.2, we preview ours in Figure 1, including the five method-\nological pathways which are quantitatively compared: 1) graph queries on the KG (called the DKG) derived\n“directly” from GKG2; 2) use of G-Retriever2 [7] against the same DKG; 3) RAG against a vector store\nrepresentation of GKG2; 4) G-Retriever against a second KG (called the LKG) derived from using Llamain-\ndex3 [1] against the GDELT source articles; and 5) GraphRAG4 Q&A deployed against a third KG (called\nGRKG) using Microsoft’s open-source GraphRAG package with default configuration parameters.\nFigure 1: Pipeline of different experiments ran to analyze the GDELT database using an LLM.\n2https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever\n3https://www.llamaindex.ai/\n4https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/\n2']","['<1-hop>\n\nof contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and events driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.

The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 improves role and location association and introduces several new features as follows:

### Improvements in Role and Location Association:
- **Character Offset for References:**  
  GKG 2.1 provides the approximate character offset of each reference to an object (such as a person, organization, location, or role) within the original article text. This allows for simple proximity-based contextualization, enabling users to associate specific people with their corresponding locations and functional roles more accurately.  
  - For example, if an article mentions Barack Obama, John Kerry, Vladimir Putin, the United States, Russia, and roles like President and Secretary of State, the character offset data helps determine which person is mentioned closer to which location or role. This proximity information helps recover functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations that were difficult to establish in previous versions.

### New Features Introduced in GKG 2.1:
1. **Over 100 New Themes:**  
   The GKG now includes more than 100 new themes covering a wide range of topics such as economic indicators (e.g., price gouging, price of heating oil), infrastructure (e.g., construction of power generation capacity), social issues (e.g., marginalization, burning in effigy), expanded lists of infectious diseases, ethnic groups, terrorism organizations, over 600 global humanitarian and development aid organizations, global currencies, and new taxonomies for animals and plants to track species migration and poaching.

2. **Extensible XML Block (V2EXTRASXML):**  
   A new XML-formatted field allows encoding of specialized data types that apply only to subsets of the collection, such as citation lists in academic literature. This extensibility supports encoding highly specialized enhanced information from diverse input streams beyond mainstream news.

3. **Unique Record Identifiers:**  
   Each GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier, facilitating easier referencing and management of individual records across the entire dataset.

4. **Single Data File Format:**  
   The previous separation of GKG data into two files (one for counts only and one full file) has been eliminated. Now, all data is provided in a single comprehensive file, simplifying data handling and ensuring users have access to all thematic and contextual data.

5. **Production Status and Stability:**  
   GKG 2.1 has moved from alpha experimental status to production status, meaning the file format is now stable and will not change, supporting widespread production use.

6. **Changes in Document Clustering and Inclusion Criteria:**  
   - GKG 2.1 no longer clusters multiple articles with the same metadata into a single record; instead, each article appears as a separate entry.  
   - The minimum inclusion criteria for articles have been relaxed: articles without any geocoded location but containing any extracted information (including emotional scores) are now included, broadening the scope of the dataset to cover topics without strong geographic references (e.g., cybersecurity, constitutional discourse).

---

### Summary:
GKG 2.1 enhances the ability to associate roles and locations by providing character offsets for references within articles, enabling proximity-based contextualization. It also introduces over 100 new thematic categories, an extensible XML field for specialized data, unique record identifiers, a unified data file format, and improved inclusion criteria, all while stabilizing the format for production use.","GDELT Global Knowledge Graph 2.1 improves role and location association by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article, allowing simple proximity-based contextualization. This means mentions of people, locations, and roles can be associated based on how close they appear in the text, enabling exploration of functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations. Additionally, GKG 2.1 introduces over 100 new themes covering economic, infrastructure, social issues, and expanded taxonomies including infectious diseases, ethnic groups, terrorism organizations, humanitarian aid organizations, global currencies, and species tracking. It also includes an extensible XML block called V2EXTRASXML to encode specialized data types from sources like academic literature, enhancing the ability to represent complex and specialized information within the GKG framework.",0.9655172413793104,0.933372395527218,0.3333333333,1.0
"how GCAM real-time measurement of 2,300 emotions and themes affect the changes in GKG 2.1 format and its article inclusion criteria?","['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'the MentionIdentifier field above to merge the Mentions table with the GKG table to access the \ncomplete set of 2,300 emotions and themes from the GCAM system.    \n\uf0b7 \nMentionDocTranslationInfo.  (string)  This field is internally delimited by semicolons and is used \nto record provenance information for machine translated documents indicating the original \nsource language and the citation of the translation system used to translate the document for \nprocessing.  It will be blank for documents originally in English.  At this time the field will also be \nblank for documents translated by a human translator and provided to GDELT in English (such as \nBBC Monitoring materials) – in future this field may be expanded to include information on \nhuman translation pipelines, but at present it only captures information on machine translated \nmaterials.  An example of the contents of this field might be “srclc:fra; eng:Moses 2.1.1 / \nMosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0”.  NOTE:  Machine translation is often not as accurate as \nhuman translation and users requiring the highest possible confidence levels may wish to \nexclude events whose only mentions are in translated reports, while those needing the highest-\npossible coverage of the non-Western world will find that these events often offer the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or smaller-bore events of less interest to Western media.   \no SRCLC. This is the Source Language Code, representing the three-letter ISO639-2 code of \nthe language of the original source material.   \no ENG.  This is a textual citation string that indicates the engine(s) and model(s) used to \ntranslate the text.  The format of this field will vary across engines and over time and no \nexpectations should be made on the ordering or formatting of this field.  In the example \nabove, the string “Moses 2.1.1 / MosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0” indicates that \nthe document was translated using version 2.1.1 of the Moses 7 SMT platform, using the \n“MosesCore Europarl fr-en” translation and language models, with the final translation \nenhanced via GDELT Translingual’s own version 1.0 French translation and language \nmodels.  A value of “GT-ARA 1.0” indicates that GDELT Translingual’s version 1.0 Arabic \ntranslation and language models were the sole resources used for translation.  \nAdditional language systems used in the translation pipeline such as word segmentation \nsystems are also captured in this field such that a value of “GT-ZHO 1.0 / Stanford PKU” \nindicates that the Stanford Chinese Word Segmenter 8 was used to segment the text \ninto individual words and sentences, which were then translated by GDELT \nTranslingual’s own version 1.0 Chinese (Traditional or Simplified) translation and \nlanguage models. \n\uf0b7 \nExtras.  (string)  This field is currently blank, but is reserved for future use to encode special \nadditional measurements for selected material. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n7 http://www.statmt.org/moses/ \n \n8 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/segmenter.shtml'
 'occurrence described in the context of a more positive narrative (such as a report of an attack \noccurring in a discussion of improving conditions on the ground in a country and how the \nnumber of attacks per day has been greatly reduced).  NOTE: this field refers only to the first \nnews report to mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context \nin other news reports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the \npositioning of an event, see the Mentions table.  NOTE: this provides only a basic tonal \nassessment of an article and it is recommended that users interested in emotional measures use \nthe Mentions and Global Knowledge Graph tables to merge the complete set of 2,300 emotions \nand themes from the GKG GCAM system into their analysis of event records. \n \nEVENT GEOGRAPHY \n \nThe final set of fields add a novel enhancement to the CAMEO taxonomy, georeferencing each event \nalong three primary dimensions to the landmark-centroid level.  To do this, the fulltext of the source \ndocument is processed using fulltext geocoding and automatic disambiguation to identify every \ngeographic reference.3  The closest reference to each of the two actors and to the action reference are \nthen encoded in these fields.  The georeferenced location for an actor may not always match the \nActor1_CountryCode or Actor2_CountryCode field, such as in a case where the President of Russia is \nvisiting Washington, DC in the United States, in which case the Actor1_CountryCode would contain the \ncode for Russia, while the georeferencing fields below would contain a match for Washington, DC.  It \nmay not always be possible for the system to locate a match for each actor or location, in which case \none or more of the fields may be blank.  The Action fields capture the location information closest to the \npoint in the event description that contains the actual statement of action and is the best location to use \nfor placing events on a map or in other spatial context.   \n \nTo find all events located in or relating to a specific city or geographic landmark, the Geo_FeatureID \ncolumn should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column.  This is because the Geo_Fullname \ncolumn captures the name of the location as expressed in the text and thus reflects differences in \ntransliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for the same location.  For example, Mecca \nis often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly spelled Jiddah or Jaddah.  The Geo_Fullname column \nwill reflect each of these different spellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the \nsame unique GNS or GNIS feature identification number.  For more information on the GNS and GNIS \nidentifiers, see Leetaru (2012). 4 \n \nWhen looking for events in or relating to a specific country, such as Syria, there are two possible filtering \nmethods.  The first is to use the Actor_CountryCode fields in the Actor section to look for all actors \nhaving the SYR (Syria) code.  However, conflict zones are often accompanied by high degrees of \nuncertainty in media reporting and a news article might mention only “Unidentified gunmen stormed a \nhouse and shot 12 civilians.”  In this case, the Actor_CountryCode fields for Actor1 and Actor2 would \nboth be blank, since the article did not specify the actor country affiliations, while their \nGeo_CountryCode values (and the ActorGeo_CountryCode for the event) would specify Syria.  This can \nresult in dramatic differences when examining active conflict zones.  The second method is to examine \nthe ActorGeo_CountryCode for the location of the event.  This will also capture situations such as the \nUnited States criticizing a statement by Russia regarding a specific Syrian attack. \n \n                                                          \n3 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n4 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.']","['<1-hop>\n\nadds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening entirely new analytic opportunities.

Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to the GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification. Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of special subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 compatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be supported for news content.

The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering. In addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article to appear in the GKG. Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output. However, many topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy discussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a single location. This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of high relevance to many GDELT user communities. Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in the GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional scores. An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,']","The real-time measurement of 2,300 emotions and themes by the GCAM (Global Content Analysis Measures) system significantly influenced changes in the GKG 2.1 format and its article inclusion criteria in the following ways:

1. **Elimination of Clustering of Articles with Identical Metadata:**
   - In the earlier GKG 1.0 format, articles with the same metadata (locations, themes, people, organizations) were clustered together into a single row, with a count of the number of articles (NumArticles).
   - With GCAM assessing over 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear that articles with identical metadata could have very different emotional and thematic profiles.
   - Therefore, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters articles based on shared metadata. Instead, each article appears as a separate entry in the GKG stream, even if multiple articles share the same locations, themes, people, and organizations. This allows the distinct GCAM emotional scores to be preserved and analyzed at the individual article level.

2. **Change in Article Inclusion Criteria:**
   - Previously (GKG 1.0 and 2.0), an article had to contain at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included in the GKG.
   - Many important topics (e.g., cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, policy discussions) often lack geographic mentions and were thus excluded.
   - With the introduction of GCAM emotional and thematic scoring, GKG 2.1 expanded the inclusion criteria: an article is included if it contains **any** successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores.
   - This means articles without geographic mentions but with emotional or thematic data from GCAM are now included, broadening the scope and relevance of the GKG dataset.

3. **Structural and Format Adjustments:**
   - The addition of GCAM data required new fields in the GKG 2.1 format to accommodate these extensive emotional and thematic measures.
   - The format was upgraded from 2.0 to 2.1 to better align with the Events dataset format and to enable future hierarchical representations.
   - The NUMARTS field used for counting clustered articles was discontinued because each article is now a separate record.

4. **Provenance and Translation Tracking:**
   - Because GCAM processes articles in real-time and across multiple languages (with real-time translation of 65 languages), GKG 2.1 includes fields like MentionDocTranslationInfo to track the provenance and translation details of each document, ensuring accurate interpretation of emotional scores.

**Summary:**  
The GCAM system’s real-time measurement of 2,300 emotions and themes necessitated that GKG 2.1 treat each article as a unique record rather than clustering by shared metadata, and broadened the inclusion criteria to accept articles without geographic data but with emotional/thematic content. This enhanced the granularity, scope, and analytic potential of the GKG dataset.","The GCAM module adds real-time measurement of more than 2,300 emotions and themes to the GKG data, representing the largest deployment of sentiment analysis in the world. This capability required significant changes in the GKG 2.1 format compared to earlier versions. Specifically, because multiple articles with the same locations, themes, people, and organizations might express very different language and thus yield very different GCAM scores, the previous clustering approach used in GKG 1.0 was no longer suitable. Therefore, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents based on shared metadata; instead, each article appears as a separate entry to preserve the distinct GCAM emotional assessments. Additionally, the inclusion criteria for articles in GKG 2.1 were changed to allow articles without any geocoded geographic location to be included if they contain any successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores. This change enables the system to capture a broader range of relevant content, such as articles on cybersecurity or policy discussions that lack geographic mentions but have important emotional and thematic data measured by GCAM.",0.9574468085106383,0.9663946329665821,0.8874999999778125,1.0
