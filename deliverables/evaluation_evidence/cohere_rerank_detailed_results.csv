How is JSON related to the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) data format and what considerations should a data scientist keep in mind when working with it?,"['THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', 'References\n[1] Knowledge\ngraph\nindex.\nhttps://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/index_structs/\nknowledge_graph/KnowledgeGraphDemo/.

It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file.

Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed.

The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","JSON is not the native data format for the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) data; instead, the GKG is provided in a tab-delimited CSV format optimized for fast scanning and processing. The codebook explains that while the GKG data could theoretically be encoded in formats like JSON, XML, or RDF, doing so would significantly increase the on-disk footprint due to the complexity and size of the data. Therefore, the GKG is only available in CSV format to maintain efficiency and scalability.

However, users who require the GKG data in JSON or other formats can write scripts in languages such as PERL or Python to convert the tab-delimited CSV data into JSON or any other desired format. This flexibility allows data scientists to work with the data in the format best suited to their tools and analysis needs.

### Considerations for Data Scientists Working with GKG Data:
1. **Preprocessing Required:**  
   The GKG format is complex and requires sophisticated preprocessing. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream designed for direct import into statistical packages, GKG data needs extraction and reprocessing before analysis.

2. **Advanced Text Processing and Scripting Skills:**  
   Users will likely need to use scripting languages (e.g., Python, PERL) to parse, filter, and transform the raw GKG data into usable forms, including converting it into JSON if desired.

3. **Handling Large and Complex Data:**  
   The GKG captures a vast array of metadata, including people, organizations, locations, themes, emotions, quotes, and numeric amounts, making it rich but also complex to handle.

4. **Optimized for Streaming and Parallel Processing:**  
   The tab-delimited, one-record-per-line format is designed for highly optimized, parallelized streamed parsing, which is important for efficiently processing the large-scale data.

5. **Statistical and Network Modeling Nuances:**  
   Incorporating GKG indicators into statistical models or network/geographic analyses requires careful consideration due to the data’s latent dimensions and complexity.

6. **File Size and Storage:**  
   Converting to JSON or XML can greatly increase file size, so data scientists should weigh the trade-offs between ease of use and storage/performance.

### Summary:
- GKG data is natively provided in a tab-delimited CSV format, not JSON, to optimize for size and processing speed.
- JSON can be generated from GKG data via scripting if needed.
- Data scientists should be prepared for advanced preprocessing and scripting to work effectively with GKG data.
- Considerations around file size, processing efficiency, and the complexity of the data’s latent dimensions are important when working with or converting GKG data.","The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) is primarily available in a tab-delimited CSV format rather than JSON due to the complexity and size of encoding it in JSON, XML, RDF, or other file formats, which significantly increases the on-disk footprint.

GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.

Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array', 'Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field', 'records GDELT’s confidence in its extraction of that event from that particular article.  This field is a \npercent, ranging from 10 to 100% and indicates how aggressively GDELT had to perform tasks like \ncoreference or grammatical restructuring to extract the event from that article.  Sorting all mentions of \nan event by this field makes it possible to identify articles featuring the strongest and most \nunambiguous discussion of an event. \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer)  This is the ID of the event that was mentioned in the article. \n\uf0b7 \nEventTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the \nevent being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT (the DATEADDED field of the original event \nrecord).  This field can be compared against the next one to identify events being mentioned for \nthe first time (their first mentions) or to identify events of a particular vintage being mentioned \nnow (such as filtering for mentions of events at least one week old). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) of the \ncurrent update.  This is identical for all entries in the update file but is included to make it easier \nto load the Mentions table into a database.   \n\uf0b7 \nMentionType.  (integer)  This is a numeric identifier that refers to the source collection the \ndocument came from and is used to interpret the MentionIdentifier in the next column.  In \nessence, it specifies how to interpret the MentionIdentifier to locate the actual document.  At \npresent, it can hold one of the following values: \no 1 = WEB (The document originates from the open web and the MentionIdentifier is a \nfully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web). \no 2 = CITATIONONLY (The document originates from a broadcast, print, or other offline \nsource in which only a textual citation is available for the document.  In this case the \nMentionIdentifier contains the textual citation for the document). \no 3 = CORE (The document originates from the CORE archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the CORE \nwebsite). \no 4 = DTIC (The document originates from the DTIC archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the DTIC website). \no 5 = JSTOR (The document originates from the JSTOR archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through your JSTOR \nsubscription if your institution subscribes to it). \no 6 = NONTEXTUALSOURCE (The document originates from a textual proxy (such as closed \ncaptioning) of a non-textual information source (such as a video) available via a URL and \nthe MentionIdentifier provides the URL of the non-textual original source.  At present, \nthis Collection Identifier is used for processing of the closed captioning streams of the \nInternet Archive Television News Archive in which each broadcast is available via a URL, \nbut the URL offers access only to the video of the broadcast and does not provide any \naccess to the textual closed captioning used to generate the metadata.  This code is \nused in order to draw a distinction between URL-based textual material (Collection \nIdentifier 1 (WEB) and URL-based non-textual material like the Television News Archive). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionSourceName.  (integer)  This is a human-friendly identifier of the source of the \ndocument.  For material originating from the open web with a URL this field will contain the top-\nlevel domain the page was from.  For BBC Monitoring material it will contain “BBC Monitoring” \nand for JSTOR material it will contain “JSTOR.”  This field is intended for human display of major \nsources as well as for network analysis of information flows by source, obviating the \nrequirement to perform domain or other parsing of the MentionIdentifier field.']","['Date Mentions.

how GKG 2.1 help to know Russia with people and roles in news articles when before it was hard to connect them all together in one place?,"['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.

In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.

Previously, an article might list multiple people (e.g., Vladimir Putin), locations (e.g., Russia), and roles (e.g., President), but there was no way to link each person to their specific location or role. For example, it was unclear which person was associated with which role or location when multiple entities appeared in the same article.

GKG 2.1 solves this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object within the original article text. This allows for proximity-based contextualization—meaning that entities mentioned close together in the text are likely related. For instance, the mention of ""Russia"" would appear closer to ""Vladimir Putin"" than to other people, and the role ""President"" would be found near ""Vladimir Putin,"" enabling users to infer that Putin is the President of Russia.

This proximity information enables exploration of critical connections between people, their roles, geographic locations, and thematic context all in one place. Pilot tests have shown that these proximity indicators are highly effective at recovering functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations, making it much easier to connect Russia with its people and their roles across news articles than before.

"How does the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 enable the realtime measurement of emotions and themes across multiple languages, and what new analytic opportunities does this capability introduce according to the codebook?","['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.

The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.

To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day.

1. **Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes (GCAM):**  
   - GCAM integrates 24 different emotional measurement packages to assess over 2,300 distinct emotions and themes from every news article in realtime.  
   - It natively supports multilingual emotional assessment across 15 languages, including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, and others.  
   - This module captures a wide array of emotional dimensions, such as LIWC’s “Anxiety,” Lexicoder’s “Positivity,” WordNet Affect’s “Smugness,” and RID’s “Passivity,” enabling a nuanced and comprehensive emotional analysis of global news content.

2. **Realtime Translation of 65 Languages (GDELT Translingual):**  
   - GDELT 2.0 introduced GDELT Translingual, which performs realtime machine translation of news from 65 languages (covering 98.4% of non-English news volume) into English.  
   - This translation allows the entire GKG and GCAM pipelines to process global news content uniformly, regardless of the original language.  
   - By translating and processing news from a vast array of languages, GKG 2.1 can trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across different languages and media systems without language barriers.

**New Analytic Opportunities Introduced:**

- The combination of realtime multilingual emotional measurement and extensive translation capabilities enables **unparalleled assessment of emotional undercurrents and reactions at a planetary scale**.  
- Researchers and analysts can now monitor and analyze the emotional tone and thematic content of global news in realtime, across a broad spectrum of languages and cultures.  
- This capability supports new types of analyses that were previously impossible, such as tracking how different societies emotionally respond to events, comparing thematic emphases across languages, and understanding global sentiment dynamics in a unified framework.  
- The system’s ability to process every article individually (without clustering by shared metadata) preserves the unique emotional and thematic nuances of each document, enhancing the granularity and accuracy of analyses.

"How does the introduction of Unique Record Identifiers in the GKG 2.1 system address the Limitations of previous GKG system in associating contextual details such as people, locations, and functional roles within news articles?","['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html', 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.

When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.

Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.

As GDELT encodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and government reports, additional types of information are available to codify. As a first example of this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion words of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and the Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.

Previously, the GKG system could record multiple entities (e.g., people like Barack Obama, John Kerry, Vladimir Putin; locations like the United States and Russia; and roles like President and Secretary of State) mentioned in the same article but lacked the ability to associate these entities with each other within the article. For example, it could not link Barack Obama specifically to the United States or to the role of President.

GKG 2.1 addresses this by including approximate character offsets for each reference to an object in the original article, enabling proximity-based contextualization. This means that mentions closer together in the text (e.g., Barack Obama and the United States) can be inferred to be related, allowing exploration of role, geographic, thematic, and other associations.

The Unique Record Identifiers complement this improvement by enabling precise referencing of each record, facilitating the linking and analysis of these proximity-based associations within and across documents. This unique ID system ensures that each record can be distinctly identified and referenced, which is essential for managing and analyzing the complex network of contextual relationships encoded in the GKG.

In summary, Unique Record Identifiers in GKG 2.1 enable easier and more precise referencing of individual records, which, combined with the new character offset data, allows for better association and exploration of contextual details such as people, locations, and functional roles within news articles—something that was difficult or impossible in the previous GKG system.","The previous GKG system had limitations in associating various data points together, such as linking people like Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin with their corresponding locations and functional roles within the same article.

To further enhance data management and referencing, GKG 2.1 introduced Unique Record Identifiers, which assign a unique identifier to every GKG record. These identifiers do not indicate sequence but uniquely identify each record across the entire collection, making it easier to refer to and manage specific records.

The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.

How does the GKG 2.1 format improve GDELT Event Database integration and align with the Events dataset format compared to previous versions?,"['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.

Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.']","['<1-hop>\n\n\uf0b7 Single Data File. Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only and one containing the full GKG file. The original rationale for having two separate files was that users interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly all applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to contextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database. Thus, we are eliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \uf0b7 Production Status. The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into production status. This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change.', '<2-hop>\n\nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 The GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were released in that format. With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has remained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of significant enhancements to the GKG system. While it was originally intended to release these new features in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these fields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and the need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical representation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to accommodate these goals. Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to the GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification. Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of special subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 compatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be supported for news content. From a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 revolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the GKG stream. Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event stream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG metadata. Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would be grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2. With the introduction of the new GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear that the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, themes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very different GCAM scores. In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture necessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level. Thus, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of extracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the GKG stream. The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering. In addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article to appear in the GKG. Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output. However, many topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy discussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a single location. This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of high relevance to many GDELT user communities. Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in the GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional scores. An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,']","The GKG 2.1 format improves integration with the GDELT Event Database and aligns more closely with the Events dataset format through several key enhancements compared to previous versions:

1. **Single Data File Instead of Two Separate Files**  
   Previously, GKG data was split into two files: one containing only counts and another containing the full GKG data. Since most users require the full GKG data to contextualize counts and link them to the Event Database, GKG 2.1 eliminates the counts-only file, simplifying the data environment and making integration more straightforward.

2. **Document-Level Entries Instead of Clustering**  
   Unlike GKG 1.0, which clustered multiple articles with identical metadata into a single record (using a NumArticles field), GKG 2.1 treats each document as a separate entry. This change is crucial because the new GCAM system assesses thousands of emotions and themes per article, and articles with the same metadata may have very different emotional scores. This document-level granularity aligns better with the Event Database’s approach, which also treats events individually, facilitating more precise linking and analysis.

3. **Broader Inclusion Criteria for Articles**  
   GKG 1.0 and 2.0 required at least one geocoded location for an article to be included. GKG 2.1 relaxes this requirement, including articles that have any extracted information, such as GCAM emotional scores or mentions of political leaders, even if no geographic location is identified. This change allows GKG to cover a wider range of topics relevant to GDELT users and better complements the Event Database, which also includes events without strict geographic constraints.

4. **New and Reorganized Fields to Align with Events Dataset**  
   GKG 2.1 introduces several new fields and reorganizes the order of fields to better align with the Events dataset format. This facilitates structural mapping between GKG and Event data, enabling easier integration and joint analysis.

5. **Stable Production Format**  
   Moving from alpha experimental status to production status, GKG 2.1 stabilizes the file format, ensuring consistency and reliability for integration with the Event Database and other systems.

6. **Unique Record Identifiers with Provenance Information**  
   Each GKG 2.1 record has a globally unique identifier (GKGRECORDID) that encodes the date/time and batch sequence, including a marker for translated documents. This allows precise linking of GKG records to Event records and filtering by language provenance, enhancing integration capabilities.

In summary, GKG 2.1 improves GDELT Event Database integration and alignment by consolidating data files, providing document-level granularity, broadening inclusion criteria, adding new fields for structural compatibility, stabilizing the format, and implementing unique identifiers that facilitate precise record linkage.","The GKG 2.1 format improves GDELT Event Database integration by eliminating the separate counts-only file and providing a single full GKG data file that includes thematic and other data fields to contextualize counts and tie them into the Event Database. Additionally, GKG 2.1 aligns more closely with the Events dataset format by introducing new fields that enable structural mapping to a forthcoming hierarchical representation. Unlike earlier versions, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents based on shared metadata, allowing each article to appear separately with its own GCAM emotional scores, which supports more precise provenance identification and richer metadata. Furthermore, the minimum inclusion criteria were relaxed so that articles without geocoded locations but containing any extracted information, including GCAM scores, are now included, broadening the scope of relevant content for GDELT users.",0.9615384615384616,0.9888116460016526,0.9999999999666667,1.0
how gdelts event database use mentions table and confidence measure to filter gdelts event for best news report,"['THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).', 'Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field', '\uf0b7 \nMentionIdentifier.

It \ncan be used to uniquely identify the document and access it if you have the necessary \nsubscriptions or authorizations and/or the document is public access.  This field can contain a \nrange of values, from URLs of open web resources to textual citations of print or broadcast \nmaterial to DOI identifiers for various document repositories.  For example, if MentionType is \nequal to 1, this field will contain a fully-qualified URL suitable for direct access.  If MentionType \nis equal to 2, this field will contain a textual citation akin to what would appear in an academic \njournal article referencing that document (NOTE that the actual citation format will vary (usually \nbetween APA, Chicago, Harvard, or MLA) depending on a number of factors and no assumptions \nshould be made on its precise format at this time due to the way in which this data is currently \nprovided to GDELT – future efforts will focus on normalization of this field to a standard citation \nformat).  If MentionType is 3, the field will contain a numeric or alpha-numeric DOI that can be \ntyped into JSTOR’s search engine to access the document if your institution has a JSTOR \nsubscription. \n\uf0b7 \nSentenceID.  (integer)  The sentence within the article where the event was mentioned (starting \nwith the first sentence as 1, the second sentence as 2, the third sentence as 3, and so on).

1. **Mentions Table**:  
   - This table records every individual mention of an event across multiple news reports. For example, if an event is mentioned in 100 different articles, there will be 100 entries in the Mentions table, each corresponding to one mention.
   - Each mention includes detailed metadata such as the location of the mention within the article (e.g., sentence number, character offset), whether the mention was found in the raw text or required NLP synthesis, the length of the source document, and the tone of the article.
   - This granular data allows tracking the trajectory and network of a story as it spreads through global media, including mentions of historical events or anniversary references.

2. **Confidence Measure**:  
   - The Confidence field in the Mentions table represents the percent confidence that GDELT’s algorithms have in the accuracy of the event extraction from that specific news report.
   - Because news articles often contain ambiguous language and complex references, the Confidence measure helps quantify how reliably the event was identified in each mention.
   - Mentions with higher Confidence scores are more likely to be detailed, accurate, and less ambiguous descriptions of the event.
   - Mentions with a value of “1” in the InRawText field (indicating the event was found directly in the original article text without heavy NLP rewriting) tend to have stronger, more detailed references.

3. **Filtering for Best News Reports**:  
   - Users can filter the Event stream by selecting mentions with the highest Confidence scores to find the most reliable and detailed news reports about an event.
   - Additional filtering can be done based on the prominence of the mention within the article (e.g., mentions appearing in the lead paragraph versus buried at the bottom), the source language, or the length and tone of the article.
   - This dynamic filtering allows users to tailor the event data to their specific needs, whether they want to capture early, less certain reports or only the most authoritative and richly described events.

**In summary**, the GDELT Event Database leverages the Mentions table to capture all instances of an event’s reporting and uses the Confidence measure to assess the reliability of each mention.

The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.']","['<1-hop>\n\nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 The GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were released in that format.

1. **From Clustering to Individual Document-Level Analysis:**
   - **GKG 1.0 Clustering:** In the earlier GKG 1.0 format, articles with identical metadata (same locations, themes, people, organizations) were clustered together into a single record, with a count of the number of articles aggregated (NumArticles). This approach grouped multiple articles into one entry, which limited the ability to distinguish differences in emotional or thematic content between articles that otherwise shared metadata.
   - **GKG 2.1 with GCAM:** With the introduction of GCAM, which assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, clustering was no longer feasible because articles with the same metadata could have very different emotional and thematic profiles. Therefore, GKG 2.1 records each article as a separate entry, preserving the unique GCAM emotional and thematic scores for each document. This shift allows for much finer granularity in analysis, capturing subtle differences in emotional tone and thematic content at the individual article level.

2. **Expanded Emotional and Thematic Dimensions:**
   - GCAM integrates 24 emotional measurement packages, collectively assessing more than 2,300 distinct emotions and themes. This is a vast expansion beyond previous capabilities, enabling a much richer and more nuanced understanding of the emotional undercurrents in news content. For example, it includes diverse dimensions such as LIWC’s “Anxiety,” Lexicoder’s “Positivity,” WordNet Affect’s “Smugness,” and RID’s “Passivity,” among many others.
   - This broad and detailed emotional and thematic coverage allows analysts to explore complex emotional landscapes and thematic patterns in global news at an unprecedented scale.

3. **Inclusion of Articles Without Geographic Metadata:**
   - Previously, GKG 1.0 required at least one geocoded location for an article to be included, excluding many relevant articles on topics like cybersecurity or constitutional discourse that lack geographic references.
   - GKG 2.1, leveraging GCAM scores, includes articles even if they have no geographic mentions, as long as they contain any extracted information, including emotional/thematic scores. This broadens the scope of content analyzed and included in the dataset.

4. **Multilingual and Realtime Capabilities:**
   - GCAM natively assesses emotions and themes in 15 languages (including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, and others), enabling direct multilingual emotional analysis without relying solely on translation.
   - Additionally, GDELT Translingual provides realtime translation of news from 65 languages into English, allowing the entire GKG/GCAM pipeline to process global news content continuously and in realtime.
   - This multilingual and realtime processing capability enables analysts to monitor emotional and thematic trends across diverse languages and regions simultaneously, breaking down language barriers and providing a truly global, timely view of emotional undercurrents in news media.

**New Analytic Opportunities Enabled by GCAM’s Multilingual and Realtime Features:**

- **Planetary-Scale Emotional Monitoring:** Analysts can track and compare emotional reactions and thematic trends worldwide as they unfold in realtime, across multiple languages and cultures.
- **Cross-Language and Cross-Media Tracing:** The system allows tracing of people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across different languages and media systems, facilitating comprehensive global analyses.
- **Inclusion of Previously Excluded Content:** By including articles without geographic metadata but with emotional/thematic content, GCAM opens new avenues for analyzing topics that were previously underrepresented.
- **Fine-Grained Emotional and Thematic Insights:** The detailed emotional dimensions enable nuanced studies of sentiment dynamics, such as shifts in anxiety, positivity, or other specific emotions, at the article level rather than aggregated clusters.
- **Enhanced Event and Discourse Analysis:** The ability to link emotional and thematic data with other extracted metadata (quotes, names, dates, amounts) enriches contextual understanding of global events and discourse.

In summary, GCAM transforms the GKG dataset from a clustered, metadata-focused system into a highly granular, richly emotional and thematic, multilingual, and realtime analytical platform, vastly expanding the depth, breadth, and immediacy of insights that can be derived from global news content.","The introduction of the GCAM system in the GKG 2.1 format fundamentally changes how articles are represented by no longer clustering documents based on shared metadata, as was done in GKG 1.0. Under GKG 1.0, articles with identical locations, themes, people, and organizations were grouped together, which was insufficient for GCAM because multiple articles with the same metadata could express very different emotions and themes, resulting in distinct GCAM scores. GCAM assesses more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article in realtime, across 15 languages natively, enabling a highly granular and nuanced emotional and thematic analysis at a planetary scale. This shift allows GKG 2.1 to include articles even without geographic mentions, broadening the scope of content captured. Furthermore, GCAM’s realtime multilingual sentiment analysis, combined with GDELT’s realtime translation of 65 languages, opens entirely new analytic opportunities by enabling the tracing of emotional undercurrents and reactions globally without language barriers. This includes the ability to analyze a vast array of emotional dimensions from multiple established measurement packages, providing unparalleled insight into global news content and its emotional context.",1.0,0.9670803594910842,0.9999999999666667,1.0
How do the Actor1Geo and Location fields utilize FIPS10-4 codes to specify geographic locations at different administrative levels in the dataset?,"['\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_Type.

This can be used to \nfilter events by geographic specificity, for example, extracting only those events with a \nlandmark-level geographic resolution for mapping.  Note that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), \n2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still provide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the \ncentroid of that country or state, but the FeatureID field below will be blank. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_Fullname.

For US and World states it is in the format of \n“State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the format of “City/Landmark, State, \nCountry”.  This can be used to label locations when placing events on a map.  NOTE: this field \nreflects the precise name used to refer to the location in the text itself, meaning it may contain \nmultiple spellings of the same location – use the FeatureID column to determine whether two \nlocation names refer to the same place. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_CountryCode.  (string) This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code for the location. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_ADM1Code.  (string). This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code followed by the \n2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code for the administrative division \nhousing the landmark.  In the case of the United States, this is the 2-character shortform of the \nstate’s name (such as “TX” for Texas). \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_ADM2Code.  (string).  For international locations this is the numeric Global \nAdministrative Unit Layers (GAUL) administrative division 2 (ADM2) code assigned to each global \nlocation, while for US locations this is the two-character shortform of the state’s name (such as \n“TX” for Texas) followed by the 3-digit numeric county code (following the INCITS 31:200x \nstandard used in GNIS).

NOTE: some \nlocations have multiple accepted formal or informal names and this field is collapsed on name, \nrather than feature (since in some applications the understanding of a geographic feature differs \nbased on which name was used to reference it).  In cases where it is necessary to collapse by \nfeature, the Geo_FeatureID column should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column.  This \nis because the Geo_Fullname column captures the name of the location as expressed in the text \nand thus reflects differences in transliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for \nthe same location.  For example, Mecca is often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly \nspelled Jiddah or Jaddah.  The Geo_Fullname column will reflect each of these different \nspellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the same unique GNS or GNIS \nfeature identification number.  For more information on the GNS and GNIS identifiers, see \nLeetaru (2012). 3  This field is identical in format and population as the corresponding field in the \nGKG 1.0  format.

This can be used to filter counts by geographic specificity, for example, \nextracting only those counts with a landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping.  \nNote that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), 2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still \nprovide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the centroid of that country or state, but \nthe FeatureID field below will contain its textual country or ADM1 code instead of a \nnumeric featureid. \no Location FullName.  (text) This is the full human-readable name of the matched \nlocation.  In the case of a country it is simply the country name.  For US and World states \nit is in the format of “State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the \nformat of “City/Landmark, State, Country”.

1. **Country Level (FIPS10-4 Country Code):**  
   - The field **Actor1Geo_CountryCode** (and similarly Location CountryCode) contains the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code. This code uniquely identifies the country of the geographic location.  
   - For example, this code is used to specify the country when the geographic resolution is at the country level (Actor1Geo_Type = 1).

2. **First-Level Administrative Division (ADM1) Level:**  
   - The field **Actor1Geo_ADM1Code** (and Location ADM1Code) combines the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code with a 2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code.  
   - For the United States, the ADM1 code corresponds to the state's 2-character abbreviation (e.g., ""TX"" for Texas). For other countries, it is the equivalent first-level administrative division code.  
   - This allows the dataset to specify locations at the state or equivalent level (Actor1Geo_Type = 2 for US states, 5 for world states).

3. **Second-Level Administrative Division (ADM2) Level:**  
   - The field **Actor1Geo_ADM2Code** provides further granularity:  
     - For international locations, it uses the numeric Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) ADM2 code.  
     - For US locations, it combines the 2-character state abbreviation with a 3-digit numeric county code (following INCITS 31:200x standard).  
   - This field may be blank for country-level matches or some ADM1-level matches but is used to specify counties or equivalent subdivisions within states.

4. **Geographic Resolution Indicator:**  
   - The **Actor1Geo_Type** (and Location Type) field indicates the geographic resolution of the location match, with values:  
     - 1 = Country level  
     - 2 = US State  
     - 3 = US City or landmark  
     - 4 = World City or landmark  
     - 5 = World State (ADM1 outside US)  
   - This helps interpret the FIPS10-4 codes appropriately depending on the administrative level.

5. **Additional Fields for Mapping and Identification:**  
   - **Actor1Geo_Fullname** provides a human-readable name formatted according to the administrative level (e.g., ""State, Country"" for ADM1, ""City, State, Country"" for cities).  
   - **Actor1Geo_FeatureID** contains a unique identifier (GNS or GNIS FeatureID) for the location, which can be numeric or textual depending on the resolution.

In summary, the dataset uses the FIPS10-4 country codes as a base to identify countries, then appends ADM1 codes to specify first-level administrative divisions (states or equivalents), and further uses ADM2 codes for second-level divisions (counties or equivalents). This hierarchical coding system allows precise geographic specification at multiple administrative levels within the Actor1Geo and Location fields.","Both the Actor1Geo and Location fields use the 2-character FIPS10-4 country codes to specify geographic locations. Actor1Geo_CountryCode and Location CountryCode represent the country using these codes. For more detailed geographic resolution, Actor1Geo_ADM1Code and Location ADM1Code combine the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code with a 2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code to identify subdivisions such as US states or equivalent administrative divisions outside the US. This allows the dataset to specify locations at country and ADM1 levels consistently using FIPS10-4 codes.",1.0,0.9729113814227396,0.99999999995,1.0
"What are the key enhancements introduced in the GKG 2.1 format released in February 2015, and how does the availability of GDELT 2.0 event records starting February 19, 2015, relate to these changes?","['THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.

   - The previous system had two separate GKG files: one containing only Counts and another containing the full GKG data.  
   - GKG 2.1 eliminates the separate counts-only file, consolidating all data into a single comprehensive file. This simplification reflects that nearly all applications use the full GKG file to access thematic and other contextual data.

2. **Production Status:**  
   - GKG 2.1 moves the Global Knowledge Graph out of Alpha Experimental Release status into production status, meaning the file format is now stable and will not change going forward.

3. **New Fields and Structural Enhancements:**  
   - Several new fields were added to accommodate significant enhancements in the GKG system, including better alignment with the GDELT Event dataset format and enabling structural mapping to a forthcoming hierarchical representation.  
   - These new fields were initially intended to be released as extras in GKG 2.0 but were integrated into the core format in 2.1 due to their integral nature.

4. **Change in Document Clustering:**  
   - Unlike GKG 1.0, which clustered multiple articles with identical metadata into a single record (with a count of articles), GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents.  
   - Each article appears as a separate entry, even if multiple articles share the same locations, themes, people, and organizations. This change was necessary because the new GCAM system assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, and articles with the same metadata might have very different emotional/contextual scores.  
   - This also supports the need to track metadata provenance at the individual document level, especially with the introduction of real-time translation.

5. **Relaxed Inclusion Criteria for Articles:**  
   - Previously (in GKG 1.0 and 2.0), an article had to include at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included in the GKG.  
   - GKG 2.1 removes this geographic requirement, allowing articles without any geographic mentions to be included if they contain any other successfully extracted information, such as GCAM emotional scores or mentions of political leaders.  
   - This broadens the scope of the GKG to include topics that are less geographically centered, such as cybersecurity or constitutional discourse.

6. **Backward Compatibility and Format Stability:**  
   - Most previous fields are preserved for backward compatibility.  
   - Code designed for GKG 2.0 can be adapted to 2.1 with minimal changes.  
   - GKG 2.0 was only used for a few special subcollections and will not be supported for daily news content; only GKG 1.0 and 2.1 will be supported going forward.

**Relation to GDELT 2.0 Event Records Availability Starting February 19, 2015:**

- The GDELT Event Database also released a new version, GDELT 2.0, on February 19, 2015, which includes expanded event records with new features such as a Mentions table and a Confidence measure for event identification.  
- The release of GKG 2.1 and GDELT 2.0 event records on the same date reflects a coordinated upgrade of the GDELT system to more sophisticated, detailed, and production-ready data formats.  
- GKG 2.1’s enhancements, such as better alignment with the event dataset format and improved metadata granularity, complement the new GDELT 2.0 event records, enabling integrated and richer analysis of global news and events.  
- While GDELT 2.0 event records are only available from February 19, 2015 onward (with historical backfiles planned for later release), GKG 2.1 similarly marks a new production-level standard for knowledge graph data, supporting advanced analytic use cases in tandem with the event data.

**Summary:**  
GKG 2.1 introduces a single consolidated data file, moves to production status, adds new fields for enhanced metadata and structural mapping, changes from clustering articles to individual article entries, relaxes geographic inclusion criteria, and maintains backward compatibility. Its release coincides with the availability of GDELT 2.0 event records starting February 19, 2015, marking a coordinated upgrade of GDELT’s data infrastructure to support more detailed, nuanced, and production-ready global event and knowledge graph data.","The GKG 2.1 format, released in February 2015, introduced several key enhancements over the previous GKG 2.0 format, including the addition of new fields to support significant system improvements such as the GCAM system that assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, and the removal of clustering of documents based on shared metadata. Unlike GKG 1.0 and 2.0, which required at least one geocoded location for article inclusion, GKG 2.1 includes articles with any successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores, thereby broadening content coverage. Concurrently, GDELT 2.0 event records became available starting February 19, 2015, marking a transition to a new file format with expanded features such as a Mentions table and a Confidence measure for event identification. This timing aligns with the GKG 2.1 release, reflecting a broader upgrade in GDELT data formats to enhance real-time event tracking and metadata richness.",1.0,0.9251212970846986,0.99999999995,1.0
