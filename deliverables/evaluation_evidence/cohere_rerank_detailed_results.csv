How is JSON related to the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) data format and what considerations should a data scientist keep in mind when working with it?,"['THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', 'References\n[1] Knowledge\ngraph\nindex.\nhttps://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/index_structs/\nknowledge_graph/KnowledgeGraphDemo/.

GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.

In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.

Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array']","JSON is not the native or primary data format for the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) data. Instead, the GKG data is provided in a tab-delimited CSV format optimized for fast scanning and processing, with one record per line. This design choice is made because encoding the GKG data in JSON, XML, RDF, or similar formats would significantly increase the on-disk footprint due to the complexity and size of the data.

However, users who require the GKG data in JSON or other formats can convert the original CSV format into JSON by writing scripts in languages such as PERL or Python. This conversion is feasible but requires additional preprocessing.

### Key considerations for a data scientist working with GKG data in relation to JSON and data format:

1. **Data Format and Size**:  
   - The GKG is only available in a tab-delimited CSV format (with a "".csv"" extension) to keep file sizes manageable and enable fast, parallelized streaming parsing.  
   - JSON or XML formats would increase file size and processing overhead significantly.

2. **Preprocessing Requirements**:  
   - The GKG format is complex and requires sophisticated preprocessing before analysis.  
   - Data scientists will likely need to use scripting languages (e.g., Python, PERL) to parse, extract, and transform the data into JSON or other formats suitable for their analysis tools.

3. **Advanced Text Processing Skills**:  
   - Working with GKG data demands advanced text processing and scripting skills to handle the rich metadata and complex fields.  
   - This is especially important when converting to JSON, which may involve nested structures and hierarchical data representation.

4. **Integration into Statistical and Network Models**:  
   - When incorporating GKG indicators into statistical models or network/geographic constructs, additional nuance and care are required due to the data's complexity and latent dimensions.

5. **Optimization for Speed and Scalability**:  
   - The native CSV format is optimized for fast scanning and parallel processing, which may be lost if converted to JSON without careful handling.

### Summary

- **Relation of JSON to GKG**: JSON is not the native format of GKG data but can be generated from the provided CSV format through scripting.  
- **Considerations**: Data scientists should be prepared for complex preprocessing, require scripting skills, and be mindful of the trade-offs in file size and processing speed when converting to JSON or other formats. The native CSV format is optimized for performance and scalability, which is important for handling the large and complex GKG dataset.","The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) is primarily available in a tab-delimited CSV format rather than JSON due to the complexity and size of encoding it in JSON, XML, RDF, or other file formats, which significantly increases the on-disk footprint.

(integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field', 'records GDELT’s confidence in its extraction of that event from that particular article.  This field is a \npercent, ranging from 10 to 100% and indicates how aggressively GDELT had to perform tasks like \ncoreference or grammatical restructuring to extract the event from that article.  Sorting all mentions of \nan event by this field makes it possible to identify articles featuring the strongest and most \nunambiguous discussion of an event. \n \n\uf0b7 \nGlobalEventID.  (integer)  This is the ID of the event that was mentioned in the article. \n\uf0b7 \nEventTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) when the \nevent being mentioned was first recorded by GDELT (the DATEADDED field of the original event \nrecord).  This field can be compared against the next one to identify events being mentioned for \nthe first time (their first mentions) or to identify events of a particular vintage being mentioned \nnow (such as filtering for mentions of events at least one week old). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionTimeDate.  (integer)  This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) of the \ncurrent update.  This is identical for all entries in the update file but is included to make it easier \nto load the Mentions table into a database.   \n\uf0b7 \nMentionType.  (integer)  This is a numeric identifier that refers to the source collection the \ndocument came from and is used to interpret the MentionIdentifier in the next column.  In \nessence, it specifies how to interpret the MentionIdentifier to locate the actual document.  At \npresent, it can hold one of the following values: \no 1 = WEB (The document originates from the open web and the MentionIdentifier is a \nfully-qualified URL that can be used to access the document on the web). \no 2 = CITATIONONLY (The document originates from a broadcast, print, or other offline \nsource in which only a textual citation is available for the document.  In this case the \nMentionIdentifier contains the textual citation for the document). \no 3 = CORE (The document originates from the CORE archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the CORE \nwebsite). \no 4 = DTIC (The document originates from the DTIC archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through the DTIC website). \no 5 = JSTOR (The document originates from the JSTOR archive and the MentionIdentifier \ncontains its DOI, suitable for accessing the original document through your JSTOR \nsubscription if your institution subscribes to it). \no 6 = NONTEXTUALSOURCE (The document originates from a textual proxy (such as closed \ncaptioning) of a non-textual information source (such as a video) available via a URL and \nthe MentionIdentifier provides the URL of the non-textual original source.  At present, \nthis Collection Identifier is used for processing of the closed captioning streams of the \nInternet Archive Television News Archive in which each broadcast is available via a URL, \nbut the URL offers access only to the video of the broadcast and does not provide any \naccess to the textual closed captioning used to generate the metadata.  This code is \nused in order to draw a distinction between URL-based textual material (Collection \nIdentifier 1 (WEB) and URL-based non-textual material like the Television News Archive). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionSourceName.  (integer)  This is a human-friendly identifier of the source of the \ndocument.  For material originating from the open web with a URL this field will contain the top-\nlevel domain the page was from.  For BBC Monitoring material it will contain “BBC Monitoring” \nand for JSTOR material it will contain “JSTOR.”  This field is intended for human display of major \nsources as well as for network analysis of information flows by source, obviating the \nrequirement to perform domain or other parsing of the MentionIdentifier field.']","The ""date mentions"" in news articles refer to all day, month, and year dates that are extracted from each document.

how GKG 2.1 help to know Russia with people and roles in news articles when before it was hard to connect them all together in one place?,"['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.

Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.

Previously, an article might list multiple people (e.g., Vladimir Putin), locations (e.g., Russia), and roles (e.g., President), but there was no way to link each person to their specific location or role. For example, it was unclear which person was the President or which location was associated with which individual.

GKG 2.1 solves this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object (person, location, role) within the original article text. This allows for proximity-based contextualization—meaning that if ""Russia"" appears close to ""Vladimir Putin"" and ""President"" in the text, it can be inferred that Vladimir Putin is the President of Russia. This proximity information enables users to explore critical connections between people, their roles, and geographic or thematic associations in a way that was not possible before.

The GKG records an enormously rich array', 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.

Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,']","The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 enables the realtime measurement of emotions and themes across multiple languages primarily through its Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module and the GDELT Translingual system:

1. **Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes (GCAM):**  
   - GCAM integrates 24 different emotional measurement packages to assess over 2,300 distinct emotions and themes from every news article in realtime.  
   - It natively supports multilingual emotional assessment across 15 languages, including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, and others.  
   - This module captures a wide array of emotional dimensions, such as LIWC’s “Anxiety,” Lexicoder’s “Positivity,” WordNet Affect’s “Smugness,” and RID’s “Passivity,” enabling a nuanced and comprehensive emotional analysis of global news content.

2. **Realtime Translation of 65 Languages (GDELT Translingual):**  
   - GDELT 2.0 introduced GDELT Translingual, which performs realtime machine translation of news from 65 languages into English.  
   - This translation covers 98.4% of the daily non-English news volume monitored by GDELT, allowing the entire global news stream to be processed uniformly through the GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  
   - This capability effectively removes language barriers, enabling the system to trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems worldwide.

**New Analytic Opportunities Introduced:**

- The combination of GCAM’s extensive emotional and thematic measurement with GDELT Translingual’s realtime translation allows for **unparalleled assessment of emotional undercurrents and reactions at a planetary scale**.  
- Researchers and analysts can now monitor and analyze the emotional tone and thematic content of news globally, in realtime, across a vast array of languages and cultural contexts.  
- This capability supports new types of analyses that were previously impossible, such as tracking the evolution of global sentiment on specific issues, comparing emotional responses across different linguistic and cultural regions, and integrating emotional data with geographic, network, and event data for richer contextual understanding.  
- The GKG 2.1 format also supports document-level metadata provenance, enabling more precise and granular analysis of emotional and thematic content without clustering articles together, which preserves the unique emotional signatures of individual articles.

In summary, GKG Version 2.1’s integration of massive multilingual sentiment analysis and realtime translation opens up entirely new possibilities for global-scale, realtime emotional and thematic analytics in news media.","The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 enhances the ability to measure emotions and themes in realtime by integrating the GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module, which deploys 24 emotional measurement packages assessing more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article. This system natively analyzes emotions in 15 languages, including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, and Spanish, among others. Additionally, GDELT 2.0 introduces GDELT Translingual, a realtime streaming news machine translation system that translates news from 65 languages into English, covering 98.4% of non-English monitoring volume. This allows the GKG to process news reports globally across languages, tracing people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions seamlessly. These capabilities open entirely new analytic opportunities by enabling unparalleled assessment of emotional undercurrents and reactions at a planetary scale, supporting sophisticated sentiment analysis and cross-lingual event tracking that were not possible before.",0.9032258064516129,0.9659492150493932,0.8333333332916666,1.0
"How does the introduction of Unique Record Identifiers in the GKG 2.1 system address the Limitations of previous GKG system in associating contextual details such as people, locations, and functional roles within news articles?","['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.

The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html', 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.']","The introduction of Unique Record Identifiers (GKGRECORDID) in the GKG 2.1 system helps address the limitations of the previous GKG system in associating contextual details such as people, locations, and functional roles within news articles by providing a way to uniquely identify each GKG record across the entire collection. 

Previously, the GKG system could record multiple entities (e.g., people like Barack Obama, John Kerry, Vladimir Putin; locations like the United States and Russia; and roles like President and Secretary of State) mentioned in the same article but lacked the ability to associate each person with their corresponding location and functional role. This made it difficult to understand the relationships and contextual connections between these data points within the article.

While the Unique Record Identifiers themselves uniquely identify each record, the key advancement in GKG 2.1 that directly addresses the association problem is the provision of approximate character offsets for each reference to an object in the original article. This allows for proximity-based contextualization: by knowing where each mention occurs in the text, one can infer associations based on closeness. For example, mentions of the United States likely occur closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, and the role ""Secretary of State"" likely appears closer to John Kerry than to the others. This proximity information enables exploration of role, geographic, thematic, and other contextual affiliations that were not possible before.

In summary:

- Unique Record Identifiers (GKGRECORDID) uniquely identify each record, facilitating precise referencing and management of records.
- More importantly, GKG 2.1 provides approximate character offsets for each entity mention, enabling proximity-based association of people, locations, and roles within articles.
- This combination allows users to recover functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations that were difficult or impossible to establish in the previous GKG system.","The previous GKG system had limitations in associating various data points together, such as linking people like Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin with their corresponding locations and functional roles within the same article. Although GKG 2.1 improved this by providing approximate character offsets to enable proximity-based contextualization, it still lacked deeper semantic association. To further enhance data management and referencing, GKG 2.1 introduced Unique Record Identifiers, which assign a unique identifier to every GKG record. These identifiers do not indicate sequence but uniquely identify each record across the entire collection, making it easier to refer to and manage specific records. This addition complements the proximity-based improvements by enabling precise and unambiguous referencing of individual records, thereby addressing some of the previous system's limitations in handling complex contextual details.",1.0,0.9480717412173881,0.9999999999666667,0.8

NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.']","The introduction of unique record identifiers in GKG 2.1 addresses the limitations of the previous GKG system by enabling a precise and unambiguous reference to each individual GKG record. Previously, while the GKG system encoded various contextual details such as people, organizations, locations, and functional roles mentioned within a news article, it was difficult to associate these data points together within the same article. For example, the earlier system could identify that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin were all mentioned in an article along with the United States and Russia and roles like President and Secretary of State, but it could not link each person to their corresponding location or role.

GKG 2.1 improves on this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object within the original article, allowing for proximity-based contextualization. This means that mentions closer together in the text (e.g., Barack Obama and the United States, or John Kerry and Secretary of State) can be inferred to be related, enabling exploration of role, geographic, thematic, and other affiliations.

The unique record identifiers (GKGRECORDID) assigned to each GKG record further enhance this capability by allowing users to uniquely identify and refer to specific records across the entire collection. This unique ID, formatted with a date-time stamp and a sequential number, ensures that each record can be distinctly accessed and analyzed, facilitating more precise data handling and integration.

In summary, the unique record identifiers in GKG 2.1, combined with the inclusion of character offsets for references, overcome the previous system’s limitation by enabling simple yet effective association of people, locations, and functional roles within news articles through proximity-based contextualization and unique record referencing.","The previous GKG system struggled to associate various data points such as people, organizations, locations, and functional roles within news articles, making it difficult to link each person with the corresponding location and role. GKG 2.1 addresses these limitations by providing the approximate character offset of each reference in the original article, enabling proximity-based contextualization that helps recover functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations. Additionally, GKG 2.1 introduces unique record identifiers for every GKG record, which uniquely identify each record across the entire collection. This addition facilitates easier and unambiguous referencing of particular GKG records, thereby improving the management and association of contextual details that were previously difficult to connect.",0.96875,0.9676237579501795,0.99999999995,1.0
How does the GKG 2.1 format improve GDELT Event Database integration and align with the Events dataset format compared to previous versions?,"['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', 'THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.']","The GKG 2.1 format improves integration with the GDELT Event Database and aligns more closely with the Events dataset format through several key enhancements compared to previous versions:

1. **Single Data File Instead of Two Separate Files**  
   Previously, GKG data was split into two files: one containing counts only and another containing the full GKG data. Since most users require the full GKG data to contextualize counts and link them to the Event Database, GKG 2.1 eliminates the counts-only file, simplifying the data environment and making integration more straightforward.

2. **Document-Level Entries Instead of Clustering**  
   Unlike GKG 1.0, which clustered multiple articles with identical metadata into a single record (using a NumArticles field), GKG 2.1 treats each document as a separate entry. This change is crucial because the new GCAM system assesses thousands of emotions and themes per article, and articles with the same metadata may have very different emotional/thematic scores. This document-level granularity aligns better with the Event Database’s approach, which also treats events individually, facilitating more precise linking and analysis.

3. **Broader Inclusion Criteria for Articles**  
   GKG 1.0 and 2.0 required at least one geocoded location for an article to be included. GKG 2.1 relaxes this requirement, including articles that have any extracted information, such as GCAM emotional scores or mentions of political leaders, even if no geographic location is identified. This broader inclusion captures more relevant content, including topics without strong geographic focus, improving the comprehensiveness and relevance of the GKG data in relation to the Event Database.

4. **New and Reorganized Fields to Support Structural Mapping and Alignment**  
   GKG 2.1 introduces several new fields and reorganizes the order of fields to better accommodate enhancements and to enable structural mapping to a forthcoming hierarchical representation. This reorganization and addition of fields were motivated by the desire to align the GKG format more closely with the Events dataset format, facilitating easier integration and interoperability between the two datasets.

5. **Stable Production Format**  
   Moving from alpha experimental status to production status, GKG 2.1 stabilizes the file format, ensuring consistency and reliability for users integrating GKG data with the Event Database.

6. **Unique Record Identifiers with Provenance Information**  
   Each GKG 2.1 record has a globally unique identifier (GKGRECORDID) that includes date, time, and a sequential number, with an indicator for translated documents. This detailed provenance information supports filtering and linking with the Event Database, which uses semi-sequential numeric IDs for events.

In summary, GKG 2.1 improves integration and alignment with the GDELT Event Database by consolidating data files, shifting to document-level records, broadening inclusion criteria beyond geographic mentions, adding and reorganizing fields for structural compatibility, stabilizing the format for production use, and providing unique identifiers that facilitate linking and filtering.","The GKG 2.1 format improves GDELT Event Database integration by eliminating the separate counts-only file and providing a single full GKG data file that includes thematic and other data fields to contextualize counts and tie them into the Event Database. Additionally, GKG 2.1 aligns more closely with the Events dataset format by introducing new fields that enable structural mapping to a forthcoming hierarchical representation. Unlike earlier versions, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents based on shared metadata, allowing each article to appear separately with its own GCAM emotional scores, which supports more precise provenance identification and richer metadata. Furthermore, the minimum inclusion criteria were relaxed so that articles without geocoded locations but containing any extracted information, including GCAM scores, are now included, broadening the scope of relevant content for GDELT users.",0.9642857142857143,0.9888116460016526,0.9999999999666667,1.0
how gdelts event database use mentions table and confidence measure to filter gdelts event for best news report,"['THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).', 'Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED. (integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database \nin YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 \nminute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \n\uf0b7 \nSOURCEURL.  (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this \nevent in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and \nflow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first \nreport, but is at least in the first few reports. \n \n \n \nMENTIONS TABLE \n \nThe Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event \ntable, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the \nglobal media system.  Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an \nevent which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table.  Mentions are \nrecorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a \nyear ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical \nevents being recontextualized into present actions.  If a news report mentions multiple events, each \nmention is recorded separately in this table.  For translated documents, all measures below are based \non its English translation. \n \nSeveral of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events \nbased on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event.  When trying to understand news \nmedia spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background \nknowledge, and complex linguistic structures.  Not every event mention will take the form of “American \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, \nFrance.”  Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris \nyesterday for a trade summit.  The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on \nUkraine.”  To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer?  Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on \nUkraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or \nperhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy?  While additional cues may be available in the surrounding \ntext, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media.  Similarly, \nit would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire \nworld and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor.  Even in \nthe case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in \nPort-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this \ndisambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity.  GDELT makes use of an array of natural \nlanguage processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context.  \nWhile these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically \ncomplex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error.  Under GDELT 1.0, the \nNumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents \nmentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to \nsix revision passes.  Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the \nMentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field', '\uf0b7 \nMentionIdentifier.  (integer)  This is the unique external identifier for the source document.  It \ncan be used to uniquely identify the document and access it if you have the necessary \nsubscriptions or authorizations and/or the document is public access.  This field can contain a \nrange of values, from URLs of open web resources to textual citations of print or broadcast \nmaterial to DOI identifiers for various document repositories.  For example, if MentionType is \nequal to 1, this field will contain a fully-qualified URL suitable for direct access.  If MentionType \nis equal to 2, this field will contain a textual citation akin to what would appear in an academic \njournal article referencing that document (NOTE that the actual citation format will vary (usually \nbetween APA, Chicago, Harvard, or MLA) depending on a number of factors and no assumptions \nshould be made on its precise format at this time due to the way in which this data is currently \nprovided to GDELT – future efforts will focus on normalization of this field to a standard citation \nformat).  If MentionType is 3, the field will contain a numeric or alpha-numeric DOI that can be \ntyped into JSTOR’s search engine to access the document if your institution has a JSTOR \nsubscription. \n\uf0b7 \nSentenceID.  (integer)  The sentence within the article where the event was mentioned (starting \nwith the first sentence as 1, the second sentence as 2, the third sentence as 3, and so on).  This \ncan be used similarly to the CharOffset fields below, but reports the event’s location in the \narticle in terms of sentences instead of characters, which is more amenable to certain measures \nof the “importance” of an event’s positioning within an article. \n\uf0b7 \nActor1CharOffset.  (integer)  The location within the article (in terms of English characters) \nwhere Actor1 was found.  This can be used in combination with the GKG or other analysis to \nidentify further characteristics and attributes of the actor.  NOTE: due to processing performed \non each article, this may be slightly offset from the position seen when the article is rendered in \na web browser. \n\uf0b7 \nActor2CharOffset.  (integer)  The location within the article (in terms of English characters) \nwhere Actor2 was found.  This can be used in combination with the GKG or other analysis to \nidentify further characteristics and attributes of the actor.  NOTE: due to processing performed \non each article, this may be slightly offset from the position seen when the article is rendered in \na web browser. \n\uf0b7 \nActionCharOffset.  (integer)  The location within the article (in terms of English characters) \nwhere the core Action description was found.  This can be used in combination with the GKG or \nother analysis to identify further characteristics and attributes of the actor.  NOTE: due to \nprocessing performed on each article, this may be slightly offset from the position seen when \nthe article is rendered in a web browser. \n\uf0b7 \nInRawText.  (integer)  This records whether the event was found in the original unaltered raw \narticle text (a value of 1) or whether advanced natural language processing algorithms were \nrequired to synthesize and rewrite the article text to identify the event (a value of 0).  See the \ndiscussion on the Confidence field below for more details.  Mentions with a value of “1” in this \nfield likely represent strong detail-rich references to an event. \n\uf0b7 \nConfidence.  (integer)  Percent confidence in the extraction of this event from this article.  See \nthe discussion above. \n\uf0b7 \nMentionDocLen.  (integer)  The length in English characters of the source document (making it \npossible to filter for short articles focusing on a particular event versus long summary articles \nthat casually mention an event in passing). \n\uf0b7 \nMentionDocTone.  (integer)  The same contents as the AvgTone field in the Events table, but \ncomputed for this particular article.  NOTE: users interested in emotional measures should use']","The GDELT Event Database uses the **Mentions table** and the **Confidence measure** to filter and identify the best news reports for each event as follows:

1. **Mentions Table**:
   - The Mentions table records every individual mention of an event found in news articles. For example, if an event is mentioned in 100 different articles, there will be 100 entries in the Mentions table for that event.
   - Each mention includes detailed metadata such as the location of the mention within the article (e.g., sentence number, character offset), whether the mention was found in the raw text or required NLP synthesis, the length of the source document, and the tone of the document.
   - This granular data allows tracking the trajectory and network of a story as it spreads through global media, including mentions of historical events or anniversary references.

2. **Confidence Measure**:
   - The Confidence field in the Mentions table provides a percentage score indicating how confident GDELT’s algorithms are that the mention accurately represents the event.
   - This measure accounts for the complexity and ambiguity in natural language processing, such as ambiguous pronouns or unclear actor references.
   - Mentions with higher Confidence scores are more likely to be accurate, detailed, and reliable descriptions of the event.
   - Mentions found directly in the raw text (InRawText = 1) tend to have stronger, more detailed references and thus higher confidence.

3. **Filtering for Best News Reports**:
   - Users can filter the Event stream by selecting mentions with the highest Confidence scores to focus on the most reliable and detailed reports.
   - Additional filtering can be done based on the mention’s position in the article (e.g., lead paragraph vs. buried mention), source language, or document length to find the most prominent and relevant news coverage.
   - This dynamic filtering allows users to tailor the event data to their needs, whether they want early, broad coverage including minor mentions or only the most significant, well-documented events.
   - By filtering mentions for highest Confidence and prominence, GDELT can identify the ""best"" news report for a given event, ensuring that the returned news is both accurate and informative.

**In summary**, the Mentions table provides a detailed record of every news mention of an event, and the Confidence measure quantifies the reliability of each mention.

"How does the introduction of the GCAM system in the GKG 2.1 format enhance the granularity and scope of emotional and thematic analysis compared to the clustering approach used in GKG 1.0, and what new analytic opportunities does GCAM enable through its multilingual and realtime capabilities?","['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.']","The introduction of the GCAM (Global Content Analysis Measures) system in the GKG 2.1 format significantly enhances the granularity and scope of emotional and thematic analysis compared to the clustering approach used in GKG 1.0 in several key ways:

1. **From Clustering to Individual Document-Level Analysis:**
   - **GKG 1.0 Clustering Approach:** In GKG 1.0, articles with identical metadata (same locations, themes, people, organizations) were clustered together into a single record, with a count of the number of articles aggregated (NumArticles). This approach assumed that articles sharing metadata also shared similar emotional and thematic content.
   - **GKG 2.1 with GCAM:** With GCAM assessing over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, it became clear that articles with the same metadata could have very different emotional and thematic profiles. Therefore, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters articles but instead records each article as a separate entry. This preserves the unique emotional and thematic nuances of each article, allowing for much finer-grained analysis.

2. **Expanded Emotional and Thematic Dimensions:**
   - GCAM integrates 24 different emotional measurement packages, collectively assessing more than 2,300 distinct emotions and themes. This is a vast expansion beyond previous capabilities, enabling detailed and nuanced emotional profiling of news content.
   - The system includes a wide array of emotional dimensions, from LIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity,” WordNet Affect’s “Smugness,” and RID’s “Passivity,” among others, allowing for a rich, multidimensional emotional and thematic analysis.

3. **Inclusion of Articles Without Geographic Metadata:**
   - Unlike GKG 1.0, which required at least one geocoded location for an article to be included, GKG 2.1 includes articles based on any successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores. This broadens the scope of content analyzed, incorporating articles on topics like cybersecurity or constitutional discourse that may lack geographic references but are rich in thematic and emotional content.

4. **Multilingual and Realtime Capabilities:**
   - GCAM natively assesses emotions in 15 languages (including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, and others), enabling direct multilingual emotional analysis without relying solely on translation.
   - GDELT Translingual translates news from 65 languages into English in realtime, allowing the entire GKG/GCAM pipeline to process global news content continuously and without language barriers.
   - This realtime, multilingual processing enables unprecedented global-scale monitoring of emotional undercurrents and thematic trends as they unfold, across diverse languages and media systems.

**New Analytic Opportunities Enabled by GCAM’s Multilingual and Realtime Capabilities:**

- **Planetary-Scale Emotional Monitoring:** The ability to measure thousands of emotions and themes in realtime across multiple languages allows analysts to track global emotional reactions and thematic shifts as events develop worldwide.
- **Cross-Language and Cross-Cultural Comparisons:** Since GCAM processes multiple languages natively and through realtime translation, it enables comparative studies of how different cultures and language communities emotionally and thematically frame the same events.
- **Enhanced Event and Narrative Tracking:** By preserving document-level emotional and thematic data, analysts can trace the evolution of narratives and emotional tones over time and across different media outlets and languages.
- **Inclusion of Previously Excluded Content:** The removal of geographic inclusion criteria and the ability to analyze articles based solely on emotional/thematic content expands the dataset to cover a wider range of topics and discourses.
- **Integration with Other Media Types:** Alongside emotional and thematic data, GKG 2.1 also incorporates relevant imagery, videos, social media embeds, quotes, and numeric data, enabling richer multimodal analyses of news content.

In summary, GCAM in GKG 2.1 transforms the GKG dataset from a clustered, metadata-aggregated format into a detailed, document-level, multilingual, and realtime emotional and thematic analysis system. This shift greatly enhances the granularity and scope of analysis and opens new possibilities for global, cross-lingual, and dynamic monitoring of news media content.","The introduction of the GCAM system in the GKG 2.1 format fundamentally changes how articles are represented by no longer clustering documents based on shared metadata, as was done in GKG 1.0. Under GKG 1.0, articles with identical locations, themes, people, and organizations were grouped together, which was insufficient for GCAM because multiple articles with the same metadata could express very different emotions and themes, resulting in distinct GCAM scores. GCAM assesses more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article in realtime, across 15 languages natively, enabling a highly granular and nuanced emotional and thematic analysis at a planetary scale. This shift allows GKG 2.1 to include articles even without geographic mentions, broadening the scope of content captured. Furthermore, GCAM’s realtime multilingual sentiment analysis, combined with GDELT’s realtime translation of 65 languages, opens entirely new analytic opportunities by enabling the tracing of emotional undercurrents and reactions globally without language barriers. This includes the ability to analyze a vast array of emotional dimensions from multiple established measurement packages, providing unparalleled insight into global news content and its emotional context.",1.0,0.9530676670689534,0.9999999999666667,1.0
How do the Actor1Geo and Location fields utilize FIPS10-4 codes to specify geographic locations at different administrative levels in the dataset?,"['\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_Type.

In the case of the United States, this is the 2-character shortform of the \nstate’s name (such as “TX” for Texas). \n\uf0b7 \nActor1Geo_ADM2Code.  (string).  For international locations this is the numeric Global \nAdministrative Unit Layers (GAUL) administrative division 2 (ADM2) code assigned to each global \nlocation, while for US locations this is the two-character shortform of the state’s name (such as \n“TX” for Texas) followed by the 3-digit numeric county code (following the INCITS 31:200x \nstandard used in GNIS).

More \ninformation on these values can be found in Leetaru (2012).6  NOTE: When Actor1Geo_Type has \na value of 3 or 4 this field will contain a signed numeric value, while it will contain a textual \nFeatureID in the case of other match resolutions (usually the country code or country code and \nADM1 code).  A small percentage of small cities and towns may have a blank value in this field \neven for Actor1Geo_Type values of 3 or 4: this will be corrected in the 2.0 release of GDELT.  \nNOTE: This field can contain both positive and negative numbers, see Leetaru (2012) for more \ninformation on this. \n \nThese codes are repeated for Actor2 and Action, using those prefixes. \n \nDATA MANAGEMENT FIELDS \n \n                                                          \n5 http://blog.gdeltproject.org/global-second-order-administrative-divisions-now-available-from-gaul/ \n6 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html', 'proximity to it.

NOTE: some \nlocations have multiple accepted formal or informal names and this field is collapsed on name, \nrather than feature (since in some applications the understanding of a geographic feature differs \nbased on which name was used to reference it).  In cases where it is necessary to collapse by \nfeature, the Geo_FeatureID column should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column.  This \nis because the Geo_Fullname column captures the name of the location as expressed in the text \nand thus reflects differences in transliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for \nthe same location.  For example, Mecca is often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly \nspelled Jiddah or Jaddah.  The Geo_Fullname column will reflect each of these different \nspellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the same unique GNS or GNIS \nfeature identification number.  For more information on the GNS and GNIS identifiers, see \nLeetaru (2012). 3  This field is identical in format and population as the corresponding field in the \nGKG 1.0  format.

1. **Country Level:**
   - The **Actor1Geo_CountryCode** and **Location CountryCode** fields contain the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code representing the country of the location.
   - When the geographic resolution is at the country level (indicated by `Actor1Geo_Type` or `Location Type` = 1), the location is identified by this country code.
   - The **FeatureID** field for country-level matches contains the textual country code (FIPS10-4), not a numeric feature ID.

2. **First-Level Administrative Division (ADM1) Level:**
   - The **Actor1Geo_ADM1Code** and **Location ADM1Code** fields contain a concatenation of the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code plus the 2-character FIPS10-4 ADM1 code for the first-level administrative division (e.g., a state or province).
   - For the United States, the ADM1 code is the 2-character short form of the state name (e.g., ""TX"" for Texas).
   - When the geographic resolution is at the US state or world state level (`Actor1Geo_Type` or `Location Type` = 2 for US states or 5 for world states), this ADM1 code specifies the location.
   - The **FeatureID** field for ADM1-level matches contains the textual ADM1 code (country code + ADM1 code), not a numeric feature ID.
   - Latitude and longitude fields provide the centroid coordinates of the ADM1 region.

3. **Second-Level Administrative Division (ADM2) Level:**
   - The **Actor1Geo_ADM2Code** field contains more detailed location information:
     - For international locations, it uses the numeric GAUL ADM2 code.
     - For US locations, it combines the 2-character state short form with a 3-digit numeric county code (per INCITS 31:200x standard).
   - This field may be blank for country-level matches or some ADM1-level matches.
   - ADM2 codes provide a finer geographic resolution below the ADM1 level.

4. **City or Landmark Level:**
   - For city or landmark matches within the US (`Actor1Geo_Type` = 3) or outside the US (`Actor1Geo_Type` = 4), the location is specified by the city or landmark name in **Actor1Geo_Fullname** or **Location FullName**.
   - The **FeatureID** field contains a signed numeric GNS or GNIS FeatureID uniquely identifying the city or landmark.
   - Latitude and longitude fields provide the centroid coordinates of the city or landmark.

5. **Summary of Geographic Resolution Codes:**
   - `1 = COUNTRY` (country-level, identified by 2-character FIPS10-4 country code)
   - `2 = USSTATE` (US state-level, identified by country code + state short form)
   - `3 = USCITY` (US city or landmark, identified by numeric FeatureID)
   - `4 = WORLDCITY` (world city or landmark, identified by numeric FeatureID)
   - `5 = WORLDSTATE` (administrative division 1 outside the US, identified by country code + ADM1 code)

In essence, the dataset uses the FIPS10-4 country codes as the base geographic identifier, extending them with ADM1 and ADM2 codes to specify subdivisions such as states and counties. For cities and landmarks, unique numeric feature IDs are used instead. This hierarchical coding allows the dataset to specify locations at varying levels of administrative granularity consistently.","Both the Actor1Geo and Location fields use the 2-character FIPS10-4 country codes to specify geographic locations. Actor1Geo_CountryCode and Location CountryCode represent the country using these codes. For more detailed geographic resolution, Actor1Geo_ADM1Code and Location ADM1Code combine the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code with a 2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code to identify subdivisions such as US states or equivalent administrative divisions outside the US. This allows the dataset to specify locations at country and ADM1 levels consistently using FIPS10-4 codes.",1.0,0.9228836119099063,0.99999999995,1.0
"What are the key enhancements introduced in the GKG 2.1 format released in February 2015, and how does the availability of GDELT 2.0 event records starting February 19, 2015, relate to these changes?","['THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but', '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,', 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).']","The key enhancements introduced in the GKG 2.1 format released in February 2015 are as follows:

1. **Single Data File:**  
   - The previous system had two separate GKG files: one containing only Counts and another containing the full GKG data.  
   - GKG 2.1 eliminates the separate counts-only file, consolidating all data into a single comprehensive file. This simplification reflects that nearly all applications use the full GKG file to access thematic and other contextual data.

2. **Production Status:**  
   - GKG 2.1 moves the system out of Alpha Experimental Release status into production status, meaning the file format is now stable and will not change going forward.

3. **New Fields and Structural Enhancements:**  
   - Several new fields were added to accommodate significant enhancements in the GKG system, including better alignment with the GDELT Event dataset format and enabling structural mapping to a forthcoming hierarchical representation.  
   - These changes required upgrading from GKG 2.0 to 2.1, as the new fields are integral and cannot be simply appended as extras.

4. **Change in Document Clustering:**  
   - Unlike GKG 1.0, which clustered multiple articles with identical metadata into a single record (with a count of articles), GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents.  
   - Each article appears as a separate entry, even if multiple articles share the same locations, themes, people, and organizations, because the new GCAM system assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, which can vary significantly between articles.

5. **Relaxed Inclusion Criteria:**  
   - Previously (GKG 1.0 and 2.0), an article had to contain at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included.  
   - GKG 2.1 includes articles if they contain *any* successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores, even if no geographic location is mentioned. This broadens the scope to include topics without strong geographic references, such as cybersecurity or constitutional discourse.

6. **Backward Compatibility:**  
   - Most previous fields are preserved for backward compatibility.  
   - The daily GKG 1.0 files will continue to be generated in parallel for compatibility, but GKG 2.0 files will not be produced for daily news content.

**Relation to GDELT 2.0 Event Records Availability Starting February 19, 2015:**

- The GDELT 2.0 Event dataset, which includes expanded and enhanced event records with new features such as a Mentions table and Confidence measures, became available starting February 19, 2015—the same date as the GKG 2.1 release.  
- The GKG 2.1 format changes, especially the alignment of new fields with the event dataset format and the structural enhancements, were designed to better integrate with the GDELT 2.0 Event data.  
- This synchronization allows users to more effectively connect the rich contextual and latent dimension data in the GKG with the detailed event data in GDELT 2.0, facilitating more comprehensive analyses of global news and events.  
- While GDELT 2.0 event records start from February 19, 2015, the older GDELT 1.0 event files continue to be available for historical analysis, similar to how GKG 1.0 files continue alongside GKG 2.1 for compatibility.

---

**Summary:**  
GKG 2.1 introduces a single consolidated data file, moves to production status, adds new integral fields, changes document clustering to individual article entries, relaxes inclusion criteria to include non-geographic articles, and aligns structurally with the GDELT 2.0 Event dataset. The availability of GDELT 2.0 event records starting February 19, 2015, coincides with the GKG 2.1 release, enabling better integration and use of both datasets for real-time and comprehensive global event and knowledge analysis.","The GKG 2.1 format, released in February 2015, introduced several key enhancements over the previous GKG 2.0 format, including the addition of new fields to support significant system improvements such as the GCAM system that assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, and the removal of clustering of documents based on shared metadata. Unlike GKG 1.0 and 2.0, which required at least one geocoded location for article inclusion, GKG 2.1 includes articles with any successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores, thereby broadening content coverage. Concurrently, GDELT 2.0 event records became available starting February 19, 2015, marking a transition to a new file format with expanded features such as a Mentions table and a Confidence measure for event identification. This timing aligns with the GKG 2.1 release, reflecting a broader upgrade in GDELT data formats to enhance real-time event tracking and metadata richness.",1.0,0.9251212970846986,0.99999999995,1.0
