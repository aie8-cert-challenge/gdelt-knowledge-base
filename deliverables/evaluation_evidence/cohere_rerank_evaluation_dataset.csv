Can you explane the main differnces between GKG 1.0 and the newer versions in terms of data format and usage?,"['INTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","The GKG 1.0 system was the original prototype introduced on November 3, 2013, and it has been used in a wide variety of fields due to its unique indicators capturing latent dimensions of society.

1. **Data File Structure:**
   - **GKG 1.0:** There were two separate daily data files: one containing only counts and another containing the full GKG data.
   - **Newer Versions:** The separate counts-only file was eliminated, and only a single full GKG data file is provided daily. This simplifies the data environment since nearly all applications use the full GKG file for richer thematic and contextual data.

2. **Production Status and Stability:**
   - **GKG 1.0:** Was in Alpha Experimental Release status.
   - **Newer Versions:** Moved into production status with a stabilized file format that will not change, improving reliability for users.

3. **File Format and Compatibility:**
   - **GKG 1.0:** Original format.
   - **GKG 2.0:** Introduced in September 2014, used mainly for special subcollection datasets, not daily news content.
   - **GKG 2.1:** Released in February 2015, largely similar to 2.0 but with additional fields to support new features like GCAM emotional scores and better alignment with the Events dataset. Code for 2.0 can be adapted to 2.1 with minimal changes.
   - Only GKG 1.0 and 2.1 formats are supported for daily news content; no compatibility feed for 2.0 daily news.

4. **Clustering of Entries:**
   - **GKG 1.0:** Articles with identical metadata (locations, themes, people, organizations) were clustered into a single row with a count of articles (NumArticles).
   - **Newer Versions (2.1):** No longer cluster articles by shared metadata. Each article appears as a separate entry even if metadata is identical, to accommodate the new GCAM system that assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article and to track metadata provenance at the document level.

5. **Inclusion Criteria for Articles:**
   - **GKG 1.0 and 2.0:** Articles had to include at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included.
   - **GKG 2.1:** Articles are included if they contain any successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores, even if no geographic location is mentioned. This broadens coverage to topics without strong geographic references (e.g., cybersecurity, policy discussions).

6. **New Data Fields and Capabilities in Newer Versions:**
   - **GCAM Emotional and Thematic Measures:** Real-time measurement of over 2,300 emotions and themes across 15 languages.
   - **Realtime Translation:** Processing of news in 65 languages translated into English in real-time.
   - **Relevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Media Embeds:** Extraction of images, videos, and embedded social media posts related to articles.
   - **Quotes, Names, and Amounts:** Extraction of numeric amounts, named events, legislation, and attributable quotes.
   - **Date Mentions:** Extraction of all date references within articles.
   - **Proximity Context:** New capability to capture rich contextual information (details not fully provided in the excerpt).

7. **Data Format and Processing:**
   - Both versions use a tab-delimited format stored in files with a “.csv” extension for compatibility.
   - The newer versions maintain backward compatibility with most fields from 1.0 but require more sophisticated preprocessing due to increased complexity and richer metadata.

**Summary:**  
GKG 1.0 clustered articles by shared metadata and required geographic mentions for inclusion, with two separate files for counts and full data. Newer versions (especially 2.1) provide a single full data file, do not cluster articles, include articles without geographic mentions, add extensive new metadata fields (emotions, translations, multimedia, quotes, dates), and have a stable, production-ready format optimized for advanced analysis.","['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'

GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.

GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.

GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.

For a \ncomplete list of the available dimensions, along with their assigned DictionaryID and \nDimensionID codes, their assigned key, and their human name and full citation to cite that \ndimension, please see the GCAM Master Codebook. 8  NOTE: the scores for all dimensions, both \nEnglish and non-English dimensions, will be listed together in this field – please see the \ncodebooks to determine the source language of a specific dimension.  NOTE: if non-English \ndictionaries are available for a given language and generated at least one match for that \ndocument, an additional “nwc” entry will be added which reflects the word count in the native \nlanguage, since languages may have differing word counts in their native and translated forms.  \nThis count will be absent if no native dictionaries yielded a match for the document. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SHARINGIMAGE.  (textual URL)  Many news websites specify a so-called “sharing image” for \neach article in which the news outlet manually specifies a particular image to be displayed when \nthat article is shared via social media or other formats.  Not all news outlets specify a sharing \nimage and some sites simply use their logo, but for those that do use this field, it represents the \noutlet’s selection of the single image that best captures the overall focus and contents of the \nstory.  GDELT currently recognizes a variety of formats for specifying this image, including Open \nGraph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats, among others.  \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1RELATEDIMAGES.  (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News articles frequently include \nphotographs, figures, and other imagery to illustrate the story, ranging from a single illustrative \nphotograph at top, to lengthy photo essays interspersed through the entirety of an article.  Such \nimagery lends a rich visual tapestry to a news report, helping to clarify, for example, whether an \narticle about a “protest blocking a highway” involves hundreds of activists along its length, or \njust a handful of people in one location, or whether a gas explosion leveled a building or merely \nshattered its windows.  GDELT uses a suite of highly sophisticated algorithms to actually “read” \nthrough each article in the way a human would, evaluating each image on to determine its \nrelevance, based on positioning, captioning, referencing, and context, and compiles a list of the \nURLs of the images it deems to be most relevant to the article.  Thus, unrelated inset boxes, \nadvertisements, and other imagery are ignored and this field contains only a list of images most \nillustrative of the core of the story.  This feature is in alpha release and involves a number of \nhighly complex algorithms working together in concert and thus may make mistakes.  We will be \nimproving this algorithm over time and would appreciate any feedback you may have on the \nkinds of images it incorrectly includes and those that it misses. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SOCIALIMAGEEMBEDS.  (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News websites are increasingly \nembedding image-based social media posts inline in their articles to illustrate them with \nrealtime reaction or citizen reporting from the ground.  GDELT currently recognizes embedded \nimage-based Twitter and Instagram posts and records their URLs in this field.  Only those posts \ncontaining imagery are included in this field.  This acts as a form of social media “curation” in \nwhich news outlets are wading through the deluge of social media reaction or reporting about a \nspecific situation and hand-selecting key image posts deemed of greatest relevance, \n                                                          \n8 http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GCAM-MASTERCODEBOOK.xlsx']"

The Proximity Context capability enriches the Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) by recording a highly detailed array of contextual information around these date references.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer,"Version 1.0 introduced several significant changes to the GKG (Global Knowledge Graph) data, with one of the most notable being the introduction of the **Proximity Context** capability. This new feature represents a major enhancement to the overall data format and analytic potential of the GKG.

### Proximity Context Capability:
- The Proximity Context capability enriches the GKG by recording a highly detailed and nuanced array of contextual information about entities, events, and mentions within news articles and documents.
- It allows for the association of various extracted elements (such as names, quotes, amounts, and dates) based on their proximity within the text, enabling more precise and meaningful connections between these elements.
- This capability facilitates deeper analysis by linking related data points that appear close to each other in the source text, which can improve understanding of the narrative and relationships within the document.

### Impact on Encoding Date Mentions:
- Alongside Proximity Context, version 1.0 also introduced the extraction and encoding of **all day, month, and year date mentions** found in news articles and documents.
- This was a direct response to user demand for the ability to identify repeated mentions of specific dates, which can serve as indicators of phenomena such as ""anniversary violence.""
- By encoding these date mentions and linking them through Proximity Context, the system can better track and analyze temporal references within the news, providing insights into patterns and recurring events.
- The combination of date extraction with Proximity Context means that dates can be associated with nearby quotes, names, or amounts, enriching the temporal dimension of the data and enabling more sophisticated temporal analyses.

### Summary:
The introduction of the Proximity Context capability in version 1.0 fundamentally enhances the GKG by enabling richer, context-aware connections between extracted data elements. When combined with the new feature of encoding all date mentions, it allows analysts to detect and explore temporal patterns and relationships in news coverage with greater precision, such as identifying anniversaries of significant events or tracking the evolution of narratives over time.","['adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'significance, credibly, and/or interest to their audiences.  Only image-based embedded posts are \nincluded in this field – videos are identified in the following field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1SOCIALVIDEOEMBEDS.    (semicolon-delimited list of URLs).  News websites are increasingly \nembedding videos inline in their articles to illustrate them with realtime reaction or citizen \nreporting from the ground.  Some news outlets that also have television properties may cross-\nlink their television reporting into their web-based presentation.  GDELT currently recognizes \nYouTube, DailyMotion, Vimeo, and Vine videos embedded in articles and records their URLs in \nthis field.  Similarly to the field above, this allows for a form of social media “curation” of the \nvideos deemed by the mainstream media to be of greatest relevance, significance, credibly, \nand/or interest to their audiences.   \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1QUOTATIONS.  (pound-delimited (“#”) blocks, with pipe-delimited (“|”) fields).  News \ncoverage frequently features excerpted statements from participants in an event and/or those \naffected by it and these quotations can offer critical insights into differing perspectives and \nemotions surrounding that event.  GDELT identifies and extracts all quoted statements from \neach article and additionally attempts to identify the verb introducing the quote to help lend \nadditional context, separating “John retorted…” from “John agreed…” to show whether the \nspeaker was agreeing with or rejecting the statement being made.  Each quoted statement is \nseparated by a “#” character, and within each block the following fields appear, separated by \npipe (“|”) symbols: \no Offset.  This is the character offset of the quoted statement within the document, \nindicating approximately where it was found in the body.  This can be used to associate \nthe date with the entries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appeared in closest \nproximity to it. \no Length.  This is the length of the quoted statement in characters. \no Verb.  This is the verb used to introduce the quote, allowing for separation of \nagreement versus disagreement quotes.  May not be present for all quotes and not all \nverbs are recognized for this field. \no Quote.  The actual quotation itself. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1ALLNAMES.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This field contains \na list of all proper names referenced in the document, along with the character offsets of \napproximately where in the document they were found.  Unlike the V2ENHANCEDPERSONS and \nV2ENHANCEDORGANIZATIONS fields, which are restricted to person and organization names, \nrespectively, this field records ALL proper names referenced in the article, ranging from named \nevents like the Orange Revolution, Umbrella Movement, and Arab Spring, to movements like the \nCivil Rights Movement, to festivals and occurrences like the Cannes Film Festival and World Cup, \nto named wars like World War I, to named dates like Martin Luther King Day and Holocaust \nRemembrance Day, to named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act \nand Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  This field goes beyond people and organizations to \ncapturing a much broader view of the named events, objects, initiatives, laws, and other types \nof names in each article.  Each name reference is separated by a semicolon, and within each \nreference, the name is specified first, followed by a comma, and then the approximate character \noffset of the reference of that name in the document, allowing it to be associated with other \nentries from other “V2ENHANCED” fields that appear in closest proximity to it.  If a name is \nmentioned multiple times in a document, each mention will appear separately in this field.  This \nfield is designed to be maximally inclusive and in cases of ambiguity, to err on the side of \ninclusion of a name. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1AMOUNTS.  (semicolon-delimited blocks, with comma-delimited fields)  This field contains \na list of all precise numeric amounts referenced in the document, along with the character'
 'occurrence described in the context of a more positive narrative (such as a report of an attack \noccurring in a discussion of improving conditions on the ground in a country and how the \nnumber of attacks per day has been greatly reduced).  NOTE: this field refers only to the first \nnews report to mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context \nin other news reports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the \npositioning of an event, see the Mentions table.  NOTE: this provides only a basic tonal \nassessment of an article and it is recommended that users interested in emotional measures use \nthe Mentions and Global Knowledge Graph tables to merge the complete set of 2,300 emotions \nand themes from the GKG GCAM system into their analysis of event records. \n \nEVENT GEOGRAPHY \n \nThe final set of fields add a novel enhancement to the CAMEO taxonomy, georeferencing each event \nalong three primary dimensions to the landmark-centroid level.  To do this, the fulltext of the source \ndocument is processed using fulltext geocoding and automatic disambiguation to identify every \ngeographic reference.3  The closest reference to each of the two actors and to the action reference are \nthen encoded in these fields.  The georeferenced location for an actor may not always match the \nActor1_CountryCode or Actor2_CountryCode field, such as in a case where the President of Russia is \nvisiting Washington, DC in the United States, in which case the Actor1_CountryCode would contain the \ncode for Russia, while the georeferencing fields below would contain a match for Washington, DC.  It \nmay not always be possible for the system to locate a match for each actor or location, in which case \none or more of the fields may be blank.  The Action fields capture the location information closest to the \npoint in the event description that contains the actual statement of action and is the best location to use \nfor placing events on a map or in other spatial context.   \n \nTo find all events located in or relating to a specific city or geographic landmark, the Geo_FeatureID \ncolumn should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column.  This is because the Geo_Fullname \ncolumn captures the name of the location as expressed in the text and thus reflects differences in \ntransliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for the same location.  For example, Mecca \nis often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly spelled Jiddah or Jaddah.  The Geo_Fullname column \nwill reflect each of these different spellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the \nsame unique GNS or GNIS feature identification number.  For more information on the GNS and GNIS \nidentifiers, see Leetaru (2012). 4 \n \nWhen looking for events in or relating to a specific country, such as Syria, there are two possible filtering \nmethods.  The first is to use the Actor_CountryCode fields in the Actor section to look for all actors \nhaving the SYR (Syria) code.  However, conflict zones are often accompanied by high degrees of \nuncertainty in media reporting and a news article might mention only “Unidentified gunmen stormed a \nhouse and shot 12 civilians.”  In this case, the Actor_CountryCode fields for Actor1 and Actor2 would \nboth be blank, since the article did not specify the actor country affiliations, while their \nGeo_CountryCode values (and the ActorGeo_CountryCode for the event) would specify Syria.  This can \nresult in dramatic differences when examining active conflict zones.  The second method is to examine \nthe ActorGeo_CountryCode for the location of the event.  This will also capture situations such as the \nUnited States criticizing a statement by Russia regarding a specific Syrian attack. \n \n                                                          \n3 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n4 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html']"
How does the GKG 2.1 system improve the association of John Kerry with his functional role and geographic context compared to the previous GKG system?,"['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and events driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context. However, with the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together. For example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all appeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in that article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, but there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional roles. GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article. While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new field allows for simple proximity-based contextualization. In the case of the example article above, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry than to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to the others. In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other connectivity can be explored. Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity indicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations. \uf0b7 Over 100 New GKG Themes. There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating oil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social issues like marginalization and burning in effigy. The list of recognized infectious diseases, ethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 global humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global currencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking species migration and poaching. \uf0b7 Extensible XML Block.

As a first example of this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion words of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and the Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East. Academic literature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the papers cited within that paper. This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation graphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts. Yet, such citation lists are unique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it would be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these kinds of specialized data types. Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called V2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are applicable only to subsets of the collection. Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode highly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \uf0b7']","The GKG 2.1 system improves the association of John Kerry with his functional role and geographic context by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article.

In the previous GKG system, while it was possible to identify that John Kerry, Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, the United States, Russia, and roles such as President and Secretary of State were mentioned in the same article, there was no mechanism to link each person specifically to their corresponding location or functional role. For example, it was unclear which person was associated with which role or geographic location.

GKG 2.1 addresses this limitation by including character offset information for each mention, enabling proximity-based contextualization. This means that mentions of John Kerry can be identified as occurring closer to the term ""Secretary of State"" and ""United States"" within the text, allowing users to infer that John Kerry is associated with the role of Secretary of State and the geographic context of the United States. Although this does not provide deep semantic linking, the proximity data effectively recovers functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations that were previously difficult to establish.

Pilot tests have demonstrated that these proximity indicators are highly effective in recovering such associations, thus significantly enhancing the ability to connect individuals like John Kerry to their roles and locations within news articles.","['of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.

 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.']"

Although the identifiers are sequential, they do not imply sequential events but serve as unique identifiers for each record, facilitating better data management and cross-referencing.

Regarding the removal of the counts-only file in the GDELT Event Database context, the original reason for having two separate GKG data files—one with counts only and one with the full GKG—was to allow users interested solely in counts to download a smaller daily file. However, in practice, nearly all applications use the full GKG file because it contains thematic and other contextual data that help interpret the counts and link them to the Event Database.

- **Unique Record Identifiers:** Added to GKG to uniquely identify each record, improving referencing and integration with the Event Database.
- **Removal of Counts-Only File:** Done to simplify the data environment since most users require the full GKG file for its richer contextual information, making the counts-only file unnecessary.","['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.

The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.  An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'

NOTE: some locations have multiple accepted formal or informal names and this field is collapsed on name, rather than feature (since in some applications the understanding of a geographic feature differs based on which name was used to reference it). In cases where it is necessary to collapse by feature, the Geo_FeatureID column should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column. This is because the Geo_Fullname column captures the name of the location as expressed in the text and thus reflects differences in transliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for the same location. For example, Mecca is often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly spelled Jiddah or Jaddah. The Geo_Fullname column will reflect each of these different spellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the same unique GNS or GNIS feature identification number. For more information on the GNS and GNIS identifiers, see Leetaru (2012). 3 This field is identical in format and population as the corresponding field in the GKG 1.0 format.

This can be used to filter counts by geographic specificity, for example, extracting only those counts with a landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping. Note that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), 2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still provide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the centroid of that country or state, but the FeatureID field below will contain its textual country or ADM1 code instead of a numeric featureid. o Location FullName. (text) This is the full human-readable name of the matched location. In the case of a country it is simply the country name. For US and World states it is in the format of “State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the format of “City/Landmark, State, Country”. This can be used to label locations when placing counts on a map.

**For Location Extraction:**

- The algorithm aggressively extracts every possible locative referent from the text, which may lead to a slightly elevated level of false positives.
- Locations are identified and represented with multiple fields including:
  - **Location Type:** Specifies the geographic resolution (e.g., country, US state, US city, world city, world state).
  - **Location FullName:** The exact name of the location as expressed in the text, capturing alternative spellings and transliterations (e.g., Mecca vs. Makkah).
  - **Location FeatureID:** A unique numeric or textual identifier (from GNS or GNIS databases) that resolves different spellings or names to the same geographic feature.
  - **Location CountryCode and ADM1Code:** Codes that help identify the country and administrative division.
  - **Location Latitude and Longitude:** Centroid coordinates for mapping the location.
- The algorithm uses these identifiers to disambiguate locations that may have multiple accepted names or spellings.
- For accurate identification, it is recommended to use the **FeatureID** rather than the full name to collapse or group location references, as the full name reflects the exact textual mention which may vary.
- The algorithm also provides enhanced location data (V2ENHANCEDLOCATIONS) that includes character offsets of each location mention in the text, allowing precise mapping of references.

**For Organization Extraction:**

- The Leetaru (2012) algorithm extracts all company and organization names found in the text, including corporations, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local organizations.
- The extraction is done through a named entity recognition process tailored to identify a broad range of organization types.
- The output is a semicolon-delimited list of organization names found in the text.

**Specific Considerations for Accurate Identification:**

- The location extraction is performed aggressively to maximize recall, which may increase false positives, so users should apply filtering or validation as needed.
- Because locations can have multiple names or spellings, the algorithm relies on unique FeatureIDs from authoritative geographic databases (GNS/GNIS) to unify these variants.
- For event georeferencing, the closest geographic reference to actors and actions is identified, which may differ from actor country codes, reflecting the actual location mentioned in the event description.
- For organizations, the algorithm includes a wide variety of entity types to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- The algorithm is also designed to handle names from diverse cultural contexts, as noted in its person name recognition capabilities, which suggests a similar robustness in organization and location extraction.

This \nis because the Geo_Fullname column captures the name of the location as expressed in the text \nand thus reflects differences in transliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for \nthe same location.  For example, Mecca is often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly \nspelled Jiddah or Jaddah.  The Geo_Fullname column will reflect each of these different \nspellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the same unique GNS or GNIS \nfeature identification number.  For more information on the GNS and GNIS identifiers, see \nLeetaru (2012). 3  This field is identical in format and population as the corresponding field in the \nGKG 1.0  format.  NOTE: there was an error in this field from 2/19/2015 through midday \n3/1/2015 that caused the CountryCode field to list the wrong country code in some cases. \no Location Type.  (integer) This field specifies the geographic resolution of the match type \nand holds one of the following values:  1=COUNTRY (match was at the country level), \n2=USSTATE (match was to a US state), 3=USCITY (match was to a US city or landmark), \n4=WORLDCITY (match was to a city or landmark outside the US), 5=WORLDSTATE \n(match was to an Administrative Division 1 outside the US – roughly equivalent to a US \nstate).  This can be used to filter counts by geographic specificity, for example, \nextracting only those counts with a landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping.  \nNote that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), 2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still \nprovide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the centroid of that country or state, but \nthe FeatureID field below will contain its textual country or ADM1 code instead of a \nnumeric featureid. \no Location FullName.  (text) This is the full human-readable name of the matched \nlocation.  In the case of a country it is simply the country name.  For US and World states \nit is in the format of “State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the \nformat of “City/Landmark, State, Country”.  This can be used to label locations when \nplacing counts on a map.  Note: this field reflects the precise name used to refer to the \nlocation in the text itself, meaning it may contain multiple spellings of the same location \n– use the FeatureID column to determine whether two location names refer to the same \nplace. \no Location CountryCode.  (text) This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code for the \nlocation.  Note: GDELT continues to use the FIPS10-4 codes under USG guidance while \nGNS continues its formal transition to the successor Geopolitical Entities, Names, and \nCodes (GENC) Standard (the US Government profile of ISO 3166). \no Location ADM1Code.  (text) This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code followed by \nthe 2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code for the administrative \ndivision housing the landmark.  In the case of the United States, this is the 2-character \n                                                          \n2 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n3 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 'occurrence described in the context of a more positive narrative (such as a report of an attack \noccurring in a discussion of improving conditions on the ground in a country and how the \nnumber of attacks per day has been greatly reduced).  NOTE: this field refers only to the first \nnews report to mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context \nin other news reports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the \npositioning of an event, see the Mentions table.  NOTE: this provides only a basic tonal \nassessment of an article and it is recommended that users interested in emotional measures use \nthe Mentions and Global Knowledge Graph tables to merge the complete set of 2,300 emotions \nand themes from the GKG GCAM system into their analysis of event records. \n \nEVENT GEOGRAPHY \n \nThe final set of fields add a novel enhancement to the CAMEO taxonomy, georeferencing each event \nalong three primary dimensions to the landmark-centroid level.  To do this, the fulltext of the source \ndocument is processed using fulltext geocoding and automatic disambiguation to identify every \ngeographic reference.3  The closest reference to each of the two actors and to the action reference are \nthen encoded in these fields.  The georeferenced location for an actor may not always match the \nActor1_CountryCode or Actor2_CountryCode field, such as in a case where the President of Russia is \nvisiting Washington, DC in the United States, in which case the Actor1_CountryCode would contain the \ncode for Russia, while the georeferencing fields below would contain a match for Washington, DC.  It \nmay not always be possible for the system to locate a match for each actor or location, in which case \none or more of the fields may be blank.  The Action fields capture the location information closest to the \npoint in the event description that contains the actual statement of action and is the best location to use \nfor placing events on a map or in other spatial context.   \n \nTo find all events located in or relating to a specific city or geographic landmark, the Geo_FeatureID \ncolumn should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column.  This is because the Geo_Fullname \ncolumn captures the name of the location as expressed in the text and thus reflects differences in \ntransliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for the same location.  For example, Mecca \nis often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly spelled Jiddah or Jaddah.  The Geo_Fullname column \nwill reflect each of these different spellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the \nsame unique GNS or GNIS feature identification number.  For more information on the GNS and GNIS \nidentifiers, see Leetaru (2012). 4 \n \nWhen looking for events in or relating to a specific country, such as Syria, there are two possible filtering \nmethods.  The first is to use the Actor_CountryCode fields in the Actor section to look for all actors \nhaving the SYR (Syria) code.  However, conflict zones are often accompanied by high degrees of \nuncertainty in media reporting and a news article might mention only “Unidentified gunmen stormed a \nhouse and shot 12 civilians.”  In this case, the Actor_CountryCode fields for Actor1 and Actor2 would \nboth be blank, since the article did not specify the actor country affiliations, while their \nGeo_CountryCode values (and the ActorGeo_CountryCode for the event) would specify Syria.  This can \nresult in dramatic differences when examining active conflict zones.  The second method is to examine \nthe ActorGeo_CountryCode for the location of the event.  This will also capture situations such as the \nUnited States criticizing a statement by Russia regarding a specific Syrian attack. \n \n                                                          \n3 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html \n4 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september12/leetaru/09leetaru.html']"
"how GKG data enhancements like realtime measurement of 2,300 emotions and themes relate to the GKG file format evolution from 2.0 to 2.1 and what changes in article inclusion criteria support these enhancements?","['<1-hop>\n\nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 The GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were released in that format. With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has remained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of significant enhancements to the GKG system. While it was originally intended to release these new features in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these fields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and the need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical representation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to accommodate these goals. Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to the GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification. Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of special subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 compatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be supported for news content. From a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 revolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the GKG stream. Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event stream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG metadata. Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would be grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2. With the introduction of the new GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear that the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, themes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very different GCAM scores. In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture necessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level. Thus, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of extracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the GKG stream. The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering. In addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article to appear in the GKG. Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output. However, many topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy discussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a single location. This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of high relevance to many GDELT user communities. Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in the GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional scores. An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 '<2-hop>\n\nadds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening entirely new analytic opportunities. Some of the most significant changes: \uf0b7 Realtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes. The GDELT Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment analysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual dimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, French, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Urdu). GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents and reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from LIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \uf0b7 Realtime Translation of 65 Languages. GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT Translingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine translation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, representing 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into English for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines. GDELT Translingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the very first glimpses of a world without language barriers. The GKG system now processes every news report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \uf0b7 Relevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds. A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now specify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that represents the core focus of the article. GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats. In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \uf0b7 Quotes, Names, and Amounts. The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food prices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable item. GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to offer numeric context to global events. In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative. Finally, GDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the evolving language used by political leadership across the world. \uf0b7']","The GKG file format evolved from 2.0 to 2.1 to accommodate significant enhancements in the GKG system, including the addition of several new fields designed to align with the Events dataset format and enable structural mapping for a new hierarchical representation. One major enhancement is the realtime measurement of more than 2,300 emotions and themes through the GCAM module, which assesses emotional undercurrents in multiple languages. To support this, the GKG 2.1 format no longer clusters documents based on shared metadata as in 1.0, allowing each article's unique GCAM scores to be preserved. Additionally, the minimum inclusion criteria changed: whereas GKG 1.0 and 2.0 required at least one geocoded location for an article to be included, GKG 2.1 includes any article with successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores, even if no geographic mentions exist. These changes in the file format and inclusion criteria directly support the enhanced analytic capabilities introduced by the realtime emotion and theme measurements.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer,"The enhancements in GKG data, such as the realtime measurement of over 2,300 emotions and themes via the GCAM module, are directly related to the evolution of the GKG file format from version 2.0 to 2.1. These enhancements necessitated changes in the file format and article inclusion criteria to support the richer, more granular data.

**Relation of GCAM Enhancements to GKG File Format Evolution:**

- **New Fields Added in GKG 2.1:**  
  The GKG 2.1 format, introduced in February 2015, added several new fields to accommodate significant enhancements like GCAM’s realtime emotional and thematic measurements. While initially planned to be included in the V2EXTRASXML field of GKG 2.0, the integral nature of these new data fields, the need for alignment with the Events dataset format, and the requirement for structural mapping to a new hierarchical representation led to the upgrade to GKG 2.1.  
  This means that GKG 2.1 explicitly supports the inclusion of detailed emotional and thematic data extracted from each article, enabling users to analyze emotional undercurrents and themes at a planetary scale.

- **No Clustering of Articles in GKG 2.1:**  
  Under GKG 1.0, articles with identical metadata (locations, themes, people, organizations) were clustered into a single record with a count of articles (NumArticles). However, with GCAM assessing over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, articles with the same metadata could have very different emotional scores. Therefore, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters articles based on shared metadata; instead, each article appears as a separate entry. This change supports the detailed, article-level emotional and thematic data provided by GCAM.

**Changes in Article Inclusion Criteria Supporting These Enhancements:**

- **Broader Inclusion Beyond Geocoded Articles:**  
  Previously (GKG 1.0 and 2.0), an article had to contain at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included in the GKG. This excluded many relevant articles on topics without strong geographic references (e.g., cybersecurity, constitutional discourse).  
  Starting with GKG 2.1, the inclusion criteria were expanded: an article is included if it contains *any* successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores. This means articles without geographic mentions but with emotional or thematic data are now included, greatly expanding the scope and relevance of the GKG dataset.

- **Support for Multilingual and Translated Content:**  
  The GKG 2.1 format supports realtime translation of 65 languages, allowing GCAM to assess emotions and themes across multiple languages. This multilingual capability is integrated into the format and inclusion criteria, ensuring that emotional and thematic data from a wide range of global news sources are captured.

**Summary:**

- The realtime measurement of 2,300+ emotions and themes by GCAM required the addition of new fields and structural changes in the GKG file format, leading to the upgrade from 2.0 to 2.1.  
- GKG 2.1 eliminated article clustering to preserve article-level emotional and thematic distinctions.  
- The article inclusion criteria were broadened to include articles without geographic data but with emotional/thematic information, supporting the richer GCAM data.  
- These changes collectively enable more detailed, nuanced, and globally comprehensive analysis of news content at the article level.","['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.

Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.']"

(integer) This field stores the date the event was added to the master database in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone. For those needing to access events at 15 minute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries. \uf0b7 SOURCEURL. (string) This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this event in. In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and flow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first report, but is at least in the first few reports.'
 '<2-hop>\n\nMENTIONS TABLE The Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event table, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the global media system. Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an event which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table. Mentions are recorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a year ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical events being recontextualized into present actions. If a news report mentions multiple events, each mention is recorded separately in this table. For translated documents, all measures below are based on its English translation. Several of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events based on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event. When trying to understand news media spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background knowledge, and complex linguistic structures. Not every event mention will take the form of “American President Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, France.” Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris yesterday for a trade summit. The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on Ukraine.” To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer? Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on Ukraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or perhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy? While additional cues may be available in the surrounding text, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media. Similarly, it would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire world and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor. Even in the case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in Port-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this disambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity. GDELT makes use of an array of natural language processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context. While these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically complex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error. Under GDELT 1.0, the NumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents mentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to six revision passes. Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the Mentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field']","Event sourcing is supported by the DATEADDED field, which stores the date the event was added to the master database in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in UTC timezone, allowing queries at 15 minute resolution to access events precisely. This precise timestamping helps in event tracking within the Mentions table, which records each mention of events from the Event table, even if an event is mentioned multiple times across different articles or at different times. The Mentions table enables tracking the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through global media, including mentions of historical or anniversary events. Additionally, the Confidence field in the Mentions table is important because event mentions often contain linguistic ambiguities and complex references, making extraction challenging. GDELT uses natural language processing algorithms to disambiguate mentions, but this can introduce errors. Therefore, the Confidence measure helps filter and assess the reliability of event mentions, improving the accuracy of event sourcing and event tracking.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer,"Event sourcing with the **DATEADDED** field helps event tracking in the Mentions table by providing a precise timestamp (in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS UTC format) of when the event was first added to the master database. This timestamp, recorded at 15-minute resolution, allows users to:

- Identify the original occurrence time of the event regardless of when it is mentioned in news reports.
- Track multiple mentions of the same event over time, even if the event is mentioned repeatedly in many articles.
- Distinguish between first mentions and subsequent mentions of an event by comparing the event's original DATEADDED timestamp (stored as EventTimeDate in the Mentions table) with the timestamp of the mention itself (MentionTimeDate).
- Filter mentions by event vintage, such as tracking mentions of historical or anniversary events that are being recontextualized in current news.

Because the Mentions table records each mention of an event separately, even if the same event is mentioned many times, the DATEADDED field anchors all these mentions to the original event record, enabling coherent event tracking and analysis of the event's media trajectory.

---

The **Confidence** field in the Mentions table is crucial for event sourcing and event tracking because it quantifies how confidently GDELT's natural language processing algorithms extracted the event from a particular article. This confidence score (ranging from 10% to 100%) reflects the degree of ambiguity or complexity involved in extracting the event, such as resolving pronouns, ambiguous actor references, or complex sentence structures.

The importance of the Confidence measure includes:

- Allowing users to filter mentions to focus on those with the highest confidence, thus prioritizing the most reliable and unambiguous event mentions.
- Helping to identify the ""best"" or most authoritative news reports about an event by sorting mentions by confidence.
- Enabling dynamic adjustment of sensitivity depending on the use case: for example, including lower-confidence mentions to detect early or minor reports, or restricting to high-confidence mentions for robust analysis of major events.
- Improving the accuracy of event tracking by reducing noise from ambiguous or uncertain mentions.

Together, the DATEADDED field and the Confidence measure enable effective event sourcing and tracking by anchoring mentions to a precise event timestamp and by providing a quality metric for each mention, facilitating nuanced analysis of how events are reported and evolve in the media over time.","['Finally, a set of fields at the end of the record provide additional data management information for the \nevent record.   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDATEADDED.

 'THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.  GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, \ncapturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2.  A wide array of variables break \nout the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, \nthe Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique \narray of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both \nactors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the \nstory of each event “in flight” through the global media system. \n \nAt present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, \nhowever in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 \nformat.  The   Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note \nthat files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited).   \n \nWith the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at \nleast through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without \nmodification.  Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning \nFebruary 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches \nback to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. \n  \nThere are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset.  The first is the \ntraditional Event table.  This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several \nchanges as noted below.  In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records \nall mentions of each event.  As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those \nmentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, \nincluding the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus \nbeing buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event \nfrom that specific news report.  The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it \npossible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases.  Those wishing to find the earliest \nglimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of \nperiod “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest \nevents with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the \nhighest Confidence measures.  This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each \nindividual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below).  It also makes it possible to \nidentify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those \nwith the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific \nsource language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).']"
how GKG 1.0 clustering and minimum article inclusion criteria different from GKG 2.0 and 2.1 and why these changes important for GKG system?,"['<1-hop>\n\nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 The GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were released in that format. With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has remained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of significant enhancements to the GKG system. While it was originally intended to release these new features in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these fields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and the need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical representation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to accommodate these goals. Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to the GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification. Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of special subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 compatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be supported for news content. From a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 revolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the GKG stream. Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event stream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG metadata. Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would be grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2. With the introduction of the new GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear that the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, themes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very different GCAM scores. In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture necessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level. Thus, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of extracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the GKG stream. The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering. In addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article to appear in the GKG. Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output. However, many topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy discussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a single location. This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of high relevance to many GDELT user communities. Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in the GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional scores. An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 '<2-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","The GKG 1.0 format applied a deduplication process that clustered together all articles yielding the same GKG metadata, grouping them into a single row with a NumArticles count. In contrast, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters documents based on shared metadata; instead, each article appears as a separate entry even if they share the same locations, themes, people, and organizations. This change was necessary because the new GCAM system assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, and articles with the same metadata might have very different GCAM scores. Additionally, real-time translation required identifying metadata provenance at the document level. Regarding minimum inclusion criteria, under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article had to have at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included. However, many important topics lack strong geographic centering and were excluded. Starting with GKG 2.1, an article is included if it contains any successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores, even if no geographic mentions are present. These changes are important because they allow the GKG system to better capture the full range of relevant content and metadata, improving its ability to represent global human society and support diverse analytic needs.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The differences between GKG 1.0 clustering and minimum article inclusion criteria compared to GKG 2.0 and 2.1 are as follows:

**1. Clustering of Articles:**

- **GKG 1.0:**  
  Articles were clustered together if they had the same GKG metadata (i.e., the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations). Multiple articles with identical metadata were grouped into a single row, with a field called `NumArticles` indicating how many articles were clustered together.

- **GKG 2.0 and 2.1:**  
  Clustering was discontinued. Each article is represented as a separate entry in the GKG stream, even if multiple articles share the same metadata. This change was necessary because the new GCAM system assesses over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, and articles with the same metadata might have very different emotional and thematic scores. Also, with the introduction of real-time translation, it became important to track metadata provenance at the individual document level.

**2. Minimum Article Inclusion Criteria:**

- **GKG 1.0 and 2.0:**  
  An article had to contain at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included in the GKG output. Articles without geographic mentions were excluded.

- **GKG 2.1:**  
  The inclusion criteria were relaxed. An article is included if it contains *any* successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores. This means articles without geographic mentions but containing other relevant metadata (e.g., political leaders, thematic content, emotional scores) are now included. This change allows inclusion of content relevant to topics that lack strong geographic focus, such as cybersecurity or constitutional discourse.

**Why These Changes Are Important for the GKG System:**

- The discontinuation of clustering allows the system to capture the nuanced differences in emotional and thematic content between articles that otherwise share the same metadata, enabling richer and more precise analysis.

- Including articles without geographic mentions broadens the scope of the GKG, allowing it to cover a wider range of topics and content that are important to users but were previously excluded due to lack of geographic data.

- Tracking metadata at the document level supports provenance and better integration with real-time translation and the GCAM system.

- Overall, these changes enhance the granularity, inclusiveness, and analytic potential of the GKG data, making it more useful and relevant for diverse research and monitoring applications.

**Summary:**

| Aspect                      | GKG 1.0                          | GKG 2.0 / 2.1                          | Importance of Change                                  |

| Article Clustering           | Articles with identical metadata clustered into one row with `NumArticles` count | No clustering; each article is a separate entry      | Captures article-level differences in emotions/themes; supports provenance tracking |
| Minimum Inclusion Criteria   | Must have at least one geocoded location | Any article with any extracted info (including emotional scores) included | Broadens content coverage to include non-geographic but relevant topics             |

These changes improve the GKG system’s ability to provide detailed, accurate, and comprehensive global content analysis.","['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.

An article that contains no recognizable geographic mentions, but lists several political leaders,'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.'
 'adds a series of new capabilities that greatly enhance what can be done with the GKG data, opening \nentirely new analytic opportunities.  Some of the most significant changes: \n \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Measurement of 2,300 Emotions and Themes.  The GDELT Global Content Analysis \nMeasures (GCAM) module represents what we believe is the largest deployment of sentiment \nanalysis in the world: bringing together 24 emotional measurement packages that together \nassess more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article in realtime, multilingual \ndimensions natively assessing the emotions of 15 languages (Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, \nFrench, Galician, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and \nUrdu).  GCAM is designed to enable unparalleled assessment of the emotional undercurrents \nand reaction at a planetary scale by bringing together an incredible array of dimensions, from \nLIWC’s “Anxiety” to Lexicoder’s “Positivity” to WordNet Affect’s “Smugness” to RID’s “Passivity”. \n\uf0b7 \nRealtime Translation of 65 Languages.  GDELT 2.0 brings with it the public debut of GDELT \nTranslingual, representing what we believe is the largest realtime streaming news machine \ntranslation deployment in the world: all global news that GDELT monitors in 65 languages, \nrepresenting 98.4% of its daily non-English monitoring volume, is translated in realtime into \nEnglish for processing through the entire GDELT Event and GKG/GCAM pipelines.  GDELT \nTranslingual is designed to allow GDELT to monitor the entire planet at full volume, creating the \nvery first glimpses of a world without language barriers.  The GKG system now processes every \nnews report monitored by GDELT across these 65 languages, making it possible to trace people, \norganizations, locations, themes, and emotions across languages and media systems. \n\uf0b7 \nRelevant Imagery, Videos, and Social Embeds.  A large fraction of the world’s news outlets now \nspecify a hand-selected image for each article to appear when it is shared via social media that \nrepresents the core focus of the article.  GDELT identifies this imagery in a wide array of formats \nincluding Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google+, IMAGE_SRC, and SailThru formats.  In addition, \nGDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to \nidentify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded \nsocial media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is \ncompiled.  This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations \nanywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act \nas a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \n\uf0b7 \nQuotes, Names, and Amounts.  The world’s news contains a wealth of information on food \nprices, aid promises, numbers of troops, tanks, and protesters, and nearly any other countable \nitem.  GDELT 2.0 now attempts to compile a list of all “amounts” expressed in each article to \noffer numeric context to global events.  In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing \nPerson and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, \nsuch as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World \nCup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran \nNuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.  Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array']"

 '<2-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their descriptions. GDELT Event records are stored in an expanded version of the dyadic CAMEO format, capturing two actors and the action performed by Actor1 upon Actor2. A wide array of variables break out the raw CAMEO actor codes into their respective fields to make it easier to interact with the data, the Action codes are broken out into their hierarchy, the Goldstein ranking score is provided, a unique array of georeferencing fields offer estimated landmark-centroid-level geographic positioning of both actors and the location of the action, and a new “Mentions” table records the network trajectory of the story of each event “in flight” through the global media system. At present, only records from February 19, 2015 onwards are available in the GDELT 2.0 file format, however in late Spring 2015 the entire historical backfile back to 1979 will be released in the GDELT 2.0 format. The Records are stored one per line, separated by a newline (\\n) and are tab-delimited (note that files have a “.csv” extension, but are actually tab-delimited). With the release of GDELT 2.0, the daily GDELT 1.0 Event files will still be generated each morning at least through the end of Spring 2015 to enable existing applications to continue to function without modification. Please note that at present, since GDELT 2.0 files are only available for events beginning February 19, 2015, you will need to use GDELT 1.0 to examine longitudinal patterns (since it stretches back to January 1, 1979) and use GDELT 2.0 moving forward for realtime events. There are now two data tables created every 15 minutes for the GDELT Event dataset. The first is the traditional Event table. This table is largely identical to the GDELT 1.0 format, but does have several changes as noted below. In addition to the Event table there is now a new Mentions table that records all mentions of each event. As an event is mentioned across multiple news reports, each of those mentions is recorded in the Mentions table, along with several key indicators about that mention, including the location within the article where the mention appeared (in the lead paragraph versus being buried at the bottom) and the “confidence” of the algorithms in their identification of the event from that specific news report. The Confidence measure is a new feature in GDELT 2.0 that makes it possible to adjust the sensitivity of GDELT towards specific use cases. Those wishing to find the earliest glimmers of breaking events or reports of very small-bore events that tend to only appear as part of period “round up” reports, can use the entire event stream, while those wishing to find only the largest events with strongly detailed descriptions, can filter the Event stream to find only those events with the highest Confidence measures. This allows the GDELT Event stream to be dynamically filtered for each individual use case (learn more about the Confidence measure below). It also makes it possible to identify the “best” news report to return for a given event (filtering all mentions of an event for those with the highest Confidence scores, most prominent positioning within the article, and/or in a specific source language – such as Arabic coverage of a protest versus English coverage of that protest).']","The unique record identifiers in the GKG are assigned to each record to align with the practices of the GDELT Event Database, where every record is uniquely identified across the entire collection, although sequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events.

This alignment facilitates easier referencing and association of specific records between the GKG and the Event Database.

Regarding the role of Confidence measures in the GDELT Event records, Confidence is a new feature introduced in GDELT 2.0 that quantifies the percent confidence in the extraction of an event from a particular news article. This measure allows users to dynamically filter the Event stream based on their specific use cases:

- For users interested in detecting the earliest or smallest events, including those that might only appear in summary or ""round up"" reports, the entire event stream can be used without filtering by Confidence.
- For users who want to focus on the largest, most significant events with detailed descriptions, filtering the event stream to include only those events with the highest Confidence scores is recommended.

Additionally, Confidence scores help identify the ""best"" news report for a given event by filtering mentions with the highest Confidence, most prominent placement within the article, or specific source languages. This flexibility enables tailored event detection and analysis depending on the desired sensitivity and specificity of the use case.","['THE GDELT EVENT DATABASE \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.0 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook provides a quick overview of the fields in the GDELT Event file format and their \ndescriptions.

 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.

This field can contain a \nrange of values, from URLs of open web resources to textual citations of print or broadcast \nmaterial to DOI identifiers for various document repositories.  For example, if MentionType is \nequal to 1, this field will contain a fully-qualified URL suitable for direct access.  If MentionType \nis equal to 2, this field will contain a textual citation akin to what would appear in an academic \njournal article referencing that document (NOTE that the actual citation format will vary (usually \nbetween APA, Chicago, Harvard, or MLA) depending on a number of factors and no assumptions \nshould be made on its precise format at this time due to the way in which this data is currently \nprovided to GDELT – future efforts will focus on normalization of this field to a standard citation \nformat).

 '<2-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION This codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands GDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to compute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document. To sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day. It has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system on November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an incredible number and diversity of fields. The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent dimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly unimaginable new applications. We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and capabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we are both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original alpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. Due to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create a raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of software packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely complex analytic needs in a single file. Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for direct import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated preprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to extract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package. Thus, users may require more advanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance may be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and network and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook. Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, or other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and size (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in these formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file format needed. The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab- delimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized streamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG. Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, despite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or “.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. The new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards compatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but']","GDELT Global Knowledge Graph 2.1 improves role and location association by providing the approximate character offset of each reference to an object in the original article, allowing simple proximity-based contextualization. This means mentions of people, locations, and roles can be associated based on how close they appear in the text, enabling exploration of functional, thematic, and geographic affiliations. Additionally, GKG 2.1 introduces over 100 new themes covering economic, infrastructure, social issues, and expanded taxonomies including infectious diseases, ethnic groups, terrorism organizations, humanitarian aid organizations, global currencies, and species tracking. It also includes an extensible XML block called V2EXTRASXML to encode specialized data types from sources like academic literature, enhancing the ability to represent complex and specialized information within the GKG framework.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1 improves role and location association and introduces several new features as follows:

  This allows for simple proximity-based association between entities, roles, and locations mentioned in the same article. For example, it becomes possible to infer that a mention of ""United States"" is closer to ""Barack Obama"" and ""John Kerry"" than to ""Vladimir Putin,"" and that the role ""Secretary of State"" is closer to ""John Kerry"" than to others.  
- **Enhanced Functional, Thematic, and Geographic Affiliations:**  
  These proximity indicators enable better recovery of functional roles, geographic locations, and thematic associations, which was difficult in previous versions where mentions were recorded but not linked.

### New Features Introduced in GKG 2.1:
- **Over 100 New Themes:**  
  The GKG now includes more than 100 new themes covering economic indicators (e.g., price gouging, heating oil prices), infrastructure topics (e.g., power generation capacity), social issues (e.g., marginalization, burning in effigy), expanded lists of infectious diseases, ethnic groups, terrorism organizations, over 600 global humanitarian and development aid organizations, global currencies, and extensive taxonomies for animals and plants to track species migration and poaching.

- **Extensible XML Block (V2EXTRASXML):**  
  A new XML-formatted field allows encoding of specialized data types applicable only to subsets of the collection, such as citation lists in academic literature. This enables the GKG to incorporate highly specialized enhanced information from diverse input streams beyond mainstream news.

- **Unique Record Identifiers:**  
  Each GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier, facilitating easier and unambiguous reference to specific records across the entire dataset.

- **Single Data File:**  
  The previous separation of GKG data into two files (one for counts only and one full file) has been eliminated. Now, all data is provided in a single comprehensive file, simplifying data handling and usage.

- **Production Status:**  
  GKG 2.1 has moved from alpha experimental release to production status, meaning the file format is now stable and will not change, supporting widespread production use.

- **Changes in Document Clustering and Inclusion Criteria:**  
  Unlike GKG 1.0, which clustered articles with identical metadata into single records, GKG 2.1 lists each article separately to preserve document-level metadata and emotional scores. Also, articles no longer need to have a geocoded location to be included; any article with successfully extracted information (including emotional scores) is included, broadening the scope of content covered.

---

**Summary:**  
GKG 2.1 enhances the ability to associate people, roles, and locations by providing character offsets for mentions, enabling proximity-based linking. It also adds over 100 new thematic categories, introduces an extensible XML field for specialized data, assigns unique record IDs, consolidates data into a single file, and broadens article inclusion criteria, all while stabilizing the format for production use.","['THE GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) \nDATA FORMAT CODEBOOK V2.1 \n2/19/2015 \nhttp://gdeltproject.org/  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis codebook introduces the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) Version 2.1, which expands \nGDELT’s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards \nactually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news.  \nIt applies an array of highly sophisticated natural language processing algorithms to each document to \ncompute a range of codified metadata encoding key latent and contextual dimensions of the document.  \nTo sum up the GKG in a single sentence, it connects every person, organization, location, count, theme, \nnews source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening \naround the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every \nsingle day. \n \nIt has been just short of sixteen months since the original prototype introduction of the GKG 1.0 system \non November 3, 2013 and in those fourteen months the GKG system has found application in an \nincredible number and diversity of fields.  The uniqueness of the GKG indicators in capturing the latent \ndimensions of society that precede physical unrest and their global scope has enabled truly \nunimaginable new applications.  We’ve learned a lot over the past year in terms of the features and \ncapabilities of greatest interest to the GKG community, and with this Version 2.1 release of the GKG, we \nare both integrating those new features and moving the GKG into production status (from its original \nalpha status) in recognition of the widespread production use of the system today. \n \nDue to the vast number of use cases articulated for the GKG, a decision was made at its release to create \na raw output format that could be processed into the necessary refined formats for a wide array of \nsoftware packages and analysis needs and that would support a diverse assortment of extremely \ncomplex analytic needs in a single file.  Unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which is designed for \ndirect import into major statistical packages like R, the GKG file format requires more sophisticated \npreprocessing and users will likely want to make use of a scripting language like PERL or Python to \nextract and reprocess the data for import into a statistical package.  Thus, users may require more \nadvanced text processing and scripting language skills to work with the GKG data and additional nuance \nmay be required when thinking about how to incorporate these indicators into statistical models and \nnetwork and geographic constructs, as outlined in this codebook.  Encoding the GKG in XML, JSON, RDF, \nor other file formats significantly increases the on-disk footprint of the format due to its complexity and \nsize (thus why the GKG is only available in CSV format), though users requiring access to the GKG in \nthese formats can easily write a PERL or Python or similar script to translate the GKG format to any file \nformat needed.  The GKG is optimized for fast scanning, storing one record per line and using a tab-\ndelimited format to separate the fields. This makes it possible to use highly optimized fully parallelized \nstreamed parsing to rapidly process the GKG.  Similar to the 1.0 format, the files have a “.csv” ending, \ndespite being tab-delimited, to address issues with some software packages that cannot handle “.txt” or \n“.tsv” endings for parsing tasks. \n \nThe new GKG format preserves most of the previous fields in their existing format for backwards \ncompatibility (and we will continue to generate the daily Version 1.0 files in parallel into the future), but'
 'of contextual details from the news, encoding not only the people, organizations, locations and \nevents driving the news, but also functional roles and underlying thematic context.  However, \nwith the previous GKG system it was difficult to associate those various data points together.   \nFor example, an article might record that Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Vladimir Putin all \nappeared somewhere in an article together and that the United States and Russia appeared in \nthat article and that the roles of President and Secretary of State were mentioned in that article, \nbut there was no way to associate each person with the corresponding location and functional \nroles.  GKG 2.1 addresses this by providing the approximate character offset of each reference \nto an object in the original article.  While not allowing for deeper semantic association, this new \nfield allows for simple proximity-based contextualization.  In the case of the example article \nabove, the mention of United States likely occurs much closer to Barack Obama and John Kerry \nthan to Vladimir Putin, while Secretary of State likely occurs much closer to John Kerry than to \nthe others.  In this way, critical information on role, geographic, thematic association, and other \nconnectivity can be explored.  Pilot tests have already demonstrated that these proximity \nindicators can be highly effective at recovering these kinds of functional, thematic, and \ngeographic affiliations. \n\uf0b7 \nOver 100 New GKG Themes.  There are more than 100 new themes in the GDELT Global \nKnowledge Graph, ranging from economic indicators like price gouging and the price of heating \noil to infrastructure topics like the construction of new power generation capacity to social \nissues like marginalization and burning in effigy.  The list of recognized infectious diseases, \nethnic groups, and terrorism organizations has been considerably expanded, and more than 600 \nglobal humanitarian and development aid organizations have been added, along with global \ncurrencies and massive new taxonomies capturing global animals and plants to aid with tracking \nspecies migration and poaching. \n\uf0b7 \nExtensible XML Block.  GDELT has historically relied primarily on mainstream news coverage for \nits source material.    Whether from print, broadcast, or web-based mediums, news coverage \nacross the world is relatively consistent in the kinds of information it captures.  As GDELT \nencodes an ever-increasing range of materials, including academic journal articles and \ngovernment reports, additional types of information are available to codify.  As a first example \nof this, Leetaru, Perkins and Rewerts (2014) 1 apply the GKG to encode more than 21 billion \nwords of academic literature, including the entire contents of JSTOR, DTIC, CORE, CireSeerX, and \nthe Internet Archive’s 1.6 billion PDFs relevant to Africa and the Middle East.  Academic \nliterature contains a list of cited references at the bottom of each article that indicate the \npapers cited within that paper.  This citation list is extremely valuable in constructing citation \ngraphs over the literature to better understand trends and experts.  Yet, such citation lists are \nunique to this class of literature and will not be found in ordinary news material and thus it \nwould be cumbersome to add additional fields to the GKG file format to handle each of these \nkinds of specialized data types.  Instead, the GKG now includes a special field called \nV2EXTRASXML that is XML formatted and includes these kinds of specialized data types that are \napplicable only to subsets of the collection.  Moving forward, this will allow the GKG to encode \nhighly specialized enhanced information from specialized input streams. \n\uf0b7 \nUnique Record Identifiers.  To bring the GKG in line with the practices of the GDELT Event \nDatabase, every GKG record is now assigned a unique identifier.  As with the event database, \nsequential identifiers do not indicate sequential events, but an identifier uniquely identifies a \nrecord across the entire collection.  The addition of unique record identifiers to the GKG will \nmake it easier to uniquely refer to a particular GKG record. \n                                                          \n1 http://dlib.org/dlib/september14/leetaru/09leetaru.html'
 '\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.  Previously there were two separate GKG data files, one containing Counts only \nand one containing the full GKG file.  The original rationale for having two separate files was that \nusers interested only in counts could download a much smaller daily file, but in practice nearly \nall applications use the full GKG file in order to make use of its thematic and other data fields to \ncontextualize those counts and to tie them into the GDELT Event Database.  Thus, we are \neliminating the separate counts-only file to simplify the GKG data environment. \n\uf0b7 \nProduction Status.  The GKG has now moved out of Alpha Experimental Release status and into \nproduction status.  This means that the file format is now stabilized and will not change. \n \nDIFFERENCES FROM GKG 2.0 \n \nThe GKG 2.0 file format debuted in September 2014 and several special subcollection datasets were \nreleased in that format.  With the debut of the GKG 2.1 format in February 2015, the format has \nremained largely the same, but with the addition of several new fields to accommodate a number of \nsignificant enhancements to the GKG system.  While it was originally intended to release these new \nfeatures in the GKG 2.0 format through the V2EXTRASXML field, the integral nature of several of these \nfields, the desire to more closely align some of them with the format used for the Events dataset, and \nthe need to enable structural mapping of several of the fields to a forthcoming new hierarchical \nrepresentation, necessitated an upgrade to the GKG file format to the new GKG 2.1 format to \naccommodate these goals.  Users will find that code designed for the GKG 2.0 format can be adapted to \nthe GKG 2.1 format with minimal modification.  Since the GKG 2.0 format was only used for a handful of \nspecial subcollection datasets and never made an appearance for the daily news content, a GKG 2.0 \ncompatibility feed will not be made available and only the GKG 1.0 and GKG 2.1 formats will be \nsupported for news content.   \n \nFrom a conceptual standpoint, two critical differences between the GKG 2.1/2.0 format and the GKG 1.0 \nrevolve around how entries are clustered and the minimum criteria for an article to be included in the \nGKG stream.  Under the GKG 1.0 format, a deduplication process similar to that used for the Event \nstream was applied to the daily GKG export, grouping together all articles yielding the same GKG \nmetadata.  Thus, two articles listing the same set of locations, themes, people, and organizations would \nbe grouped together in a single row with NumArticles holding a value of 2.  With the introduction of the \nnew GCAM system that assess more than 2,300 emotions and themes for each article, it became clear \nthat the GKG 1.0 approach would no longer work, since multiple articles yielding the same locations, \nthemes, people, and organizations might use very different language to discuss them, yielding very \ndifferent GCAM scores.  In addition, the introduction of realtime translation into the GDELT architecture \nnecessitated the ability to identify the provenance of metadata at the document level.  Thus, GKG 2.1 no \nlonger clusters documents together based on shared metadata – if 20 articles all contain the same list of \nextracted locations, themes, people, and organizations, they will appear as 20 separate entries in the \nGKG stream.  The daily GKG 1.0 compatibility stream will, however, still continue to perform clustering.  \nIn addition to the clustering change, GKG 2.1 also changes the minimum inclusion criteria for an article \nto appear in the GKG.  Under GKG 1.0 and 2.0, an article was required to have at least one successfully \nidentified and geocoded geographic location before it would be included in the GKG output.  However, \nmany topics monitored by GDELT, such as cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, and major policy \ndiscussions, often do not have strong geographic centering, with many articles not mentioning even a \nsingle location.  This was excluding a considerable amount of content from the GKG system that is of \nhigh relevance to many GDELT user communities.  Thus, beginning with GKG 2.1, an article is included in \nthe GKG stream if it includes ANY successfully extracted information, INCLUDING GCAM emotional \nscores.

In addition, GDELT also uses a set of highly specialized algorithms to analyze the article content itself to identify inline imagery of high likely relevance to the story, along with videos and embedded social media posts (such as embedded Tweets or YouTube or Vine videos), a list of which is compiled. This makes it possible to gain a unique ground-level view into emerging situations anywhere in the world, even in those areas with very little social media penetration, and to act as a kind of curated list of social posts in those areas with strong social use. \uf0b7 Quotes, Names, and Amounts.

In parallel, a new Names engine augments the existing Person and Organization names engines by identifying an array of other kinds of proper names, such as named events (Orange Revolution / Umbrella Movement), occurrences like the World Cup, named dates like Holocaust Remembrance Day, on through named legislation like Iran Nuclear Weapon Free Act, Affordable Care Act and Rouge National Urban Park Initiative.

1. **Elimination of Clustering of Articles Based on Shared Metadata:**
   - In the earlier GKG 1.0 format, articles with identical metadata (same locations, themes, people, organizations) were clustered together into a single row with a count of articles (NumArticles).
   - With GCAM assessing over 2,300 emotions and themes per article, it became clear that articles with the same basic metadata could have very different emotional and thematic profiles.
   - Therefore, GKG 2.1 no longer clusters articles based on shared metadata. Instead, each article is represented as a separate entry in the GKG stream, even if multiple articles share the same locations, themes, people, and organizations.
   - This change allows the GKG to capture the nuanced differences in emotional and thematic content that GCAM measures in real time.

2. **Change in Article Inclusion Criteria:**
   - Previously (GKG 1.0 and 2.0), an article had to contain at least one successfully identified and geocoded geographic location to be included in the GKG.
   - Many important topics (e.g., cybersecurity, constitutional discourse, policy discussions) often lack geographic mentions and were thus excluded.
   - With GCAM providing rich emotional and thematic data, GKG 2.1 now includes any article that contains **any** successfully extracted information, including GCAM emotional scores.
   - This means articles without geographic mentions but with emotional or thematic data from GCAM are now included, broadening the scope and relevance of the GKG dataset.

3. **Format and Structural Changes to Accommodate GCAM:**
   - The addition of GCAM’s extensive emotional and thematic fields required new fields in the GKG 2.1 format.
   - These fields are integral and structurally aligned with the Events dataset and future hierarchical representations, necessitating the upgrade from GKG 2.0 to 2.1.
   - The format changes also include the discontinuation of the NumArticles field due to the shift from clustering to individual article entries.

In summary, the real-time measurement of 2,300 emotions and themes by GCAM led to the GKG 2.1 format no longer clustering articles with identical metadata, instead representing each article separately to preserve emotional/thematic distinctions. It also broadened the article inclusion criteria to include any article with GCAM emotional/thematic data, even if geographic information is absent, thereby expanding the dataset’s coverage and analytic potential.","['\uf0b7 \nSingle Data File.

Finally, \nGDELT also identifies attributable quotes from each article, making it possible to see the \nevolving language used by political leadership across the world. \n\uf0b7 \nDate Mentions.  We’ve heard from many of you the desire to encode the list of date references \nfound in news articles and documents in order to identify repeating mentions of specific dates \nas possible “anniversary violence” indicators.  All day, month, and year dates are now extracted \nfrom each document. \n\uf0b7 \nProximity Context.  Perhaps the greatest change to the overall format from version 1.0 is the \nintroduction of the new Proximity Context capability.  The GKG records an enormously rich array'
 'or mentions an argument over constitutionalism or a forthcoming policy announcement, will now be \nincluded in the GKG stream.  Similarly, an article that has no recognizable metadata, but does yield \nGCAM emotional/thematic scores will also be included.  When processing GKG 2.1 files, users should \ntherefore be careful not to include any assumptions in their code as to whether an entry has extracted \ngeographic information and should check the contents of this field for mapping or other geographic \napplications. \n \n \nEXTRACTED FIELDS \n \nThe following section documents each of the fields contained in the GKG 2.1 format.  Note: the former \nformat had a NUMARTS field – this has been discontinued due to the new format’s support of multiple \ntypes of source collections beyond just news media and the requisite need to specify a source collection \nto interpret document identifiers in the new format (as discussed above).  Thus, if multiple documents \nhave identical computed metadata, in 1.0 format they would have been clustered together with \nNumArts used to indicate the multiple entries, while in the 2.1 format each document has a separate \nentry in the file.  Fields prefaced with “V1” indicate they are identical in format and population to the \nprevious GKG format.  Those prefaced with “V1.5” mean they are largely similar, but have some \nchanges.  Those prefaced with “V2” are new to the format.  Each row represents one document codified \nby the GKG and each row is tab-delimited for its major fields.  Note: the “V1/V1.5/V2” designations are \nnot included in the header row of the actual GKG output files.  Note:  the ordering of the fields in the file \nhas substantially changed from Version 2.0 to Version 2.1.  \n \n\uf0b7 \nGKGRECORDID.  (string)  Each GKG record is assigned a globally unique identifier.  Unlike the \nEVENT system, which uses semi-sequential numbering to assign numeric IDs to each event \nrecord, the GKG system uses a date-oriented serial number.  Each GKG record ID takes the form \n“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-X” or “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-TX” in which the first portion of the ID is the \nfull date+time of the 15 minute update batch that this record was created in, followed by a \ndash, followed by sequential numbering for all GKG records created as part of that update \nbatch.  Records originating from a document that was translated by GDELT Translingual will have \na capital “T” appearing immediately after the dash to allow filtering of English/non-English \nmaterial simply by its record identifier.  Thus, the fifth GKG record created as part of the update \nbatch generated at 3:30AM on February 3, 2015 would have a GKGRECORDID of \n“20150203033000-5” and if it was based on a French-language document that was translated, it \nwould have the ID “20150203033000-T5”.  This ID can be used to uniquely identify this \nparticular record across the entire GKG database.  Note that due to the presence of the dash, \nthis field should be treated as a string field and NOT as a numeric field. \n\uf0b7 \nV2.1DATE.  (integer)  This is the date in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format on which the news media \nused to construct this GKG file was published.  NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream \nfiles, this date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information \nwas extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for \nthe GDELT event stream.  This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a \ndata processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an \nSQL database for analysis.  NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that \nthe field is either not applicable or not known for those materials.  For example, OCR’d historical \ndocument collections may not have robust metadata on publication date.  NOTE: the GKG 2.0 \nformat still encoded this date in YYYYMMDD format, while under GKG 2.1 it is now in \nYYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.']"
